'Tis a strange place...new, yet ancient,<cf>too, in feel.
Fragile footing ahead, master. Tread<cf>carefully.
Aught may be hiding in the shadows.
There may be sufficient footholds to cross.
Seems this room connects to another here.
The sun is too long in coming... 'Tis<cf>perpetual night here.
This is no land of Gransys, nor of any of<cf>her neighbors. ...'Tis a strange place.
This place seems a ruin, but the design is<cf>as nothing in this land's history...
What manner of man is he, exactly?
He, too, seems like you, Arisen.
He is no simple wanderer, that much is<cf>clear.
Seems he bears us no ill will.
He seems to know aught of this place.
'Tis a man who marches to his own drumbeat.
He's a slippery character.
What errand could possibly be keeping him<cf>here?
Let us entrust the strengthening of our arms<cf>to him.
Seems he can offer a smithy's service fit to<cf>shame Gran Soren's masters.
We'll not have it open without a key.
'Tis too sturdy a door to force.
It won't budge, ser.
'Tis shut fast... We'll need a key.
Find the key, and we'll see what lies beyond.
Father...? I...
Watch duty was simpler before, I can tell you that much.
Afore now, 'twas a rare occurrence to spy a monster within a league of Gran Soren.
I hadn't so much as drawn my weapon in recent memory, in fact.
I joined the guard to battle foreign hordes, not beasts from the smoke of myth and legend.
It's a brave show to station men on the walls, but there's little use for such these days. 
Gransys has long since sued for peace with most of her neighbors.
The wars of men mean little in the face of the dragon. Even our neighbors are now come to offer aid.
I fear for the guard -- we're few of us battle-hardened.
We prospered well under the long peace of Duke Edmun, but it may yet prove our undoing.
Another of the guards asked would I desert with him when the time comes...
I would never abandon my post...though I confess seeing how the idea might take root in a man's mind...
My squadmate left his station. Ran off, like a cur into the night.
Chaos rules Gran Soren, yet I name myself fortunate. I thought the city to be leveled by the dragon's fury.
I am at peace with my decision to stay. Should I fall, I do so with honor intact.
Guh!
Guhagh!
Eeeaaagh...
Yah!
Shaaah!
How goes it?
Off with you, then.
Aye.
Keh! Not likely.
Heh, thank you.
Aren't you the charmer? That's grand.
What are you, then?
More importantly, who gave you leave to talk to me? Piss off!
Welcome to the lion's den.
You're a brave one to come near me, else a total fool.
You're a lucky one, you. I'm feeling generous today.
I'll not have my wenches tear you limb from limb, this time. Let's have a nice thank-you, then.
Speak not to me now!
I'm of a mind to crush all in arm's reach. Be gone, or I'll begin with you!
You're a real prize, to've come wandering into the lion's den, eager as you please. An imbecile or halfwit, else.
'Tis a brazen fool that comes to play with cutthroats and cutpurses.
...Just the sort I like.
I'm more the sort to enjoy the hunt, myself. No thrill in an easy meal, am I right?
What?
Keep staring and I'll put those eyes out.
Be off. Now.
Worse than a blood fly, you are!
What? State your business.
Or better, don't. I've no time for talk now. Be on your way.
What is it? I'm in no mood.
Quite idle, aren't you?
Aye, what is it? Business with me?
Well, I'm a busy woman, and I've no time for you now. Come back later.
Do as you please.
The world's not over as long as there are purses to lighten.
Uh, have a look at that sky. 'Tis a view from the world beyond.
I'll not mind dying, long as there's prey an' pretty girls in the life after.
I care not.
Hey there. Faring well?
Pockets well full, I hope?
There's no place for menfolk here. Go on!
I mislike your look, man. Come to die?
We've no place for menfolk here. Now go, afore I slit your pig throat!
I take no joy in hunting men, besides.
Another day, another prey.
Aren't you the charmer? That's grand.

Seems her distaste for men was no idle<cf>rumor.
Our path is clear -- grind the brigands<cf>underheel.
They're common criminals. We need offer<cf>no mercy.
They will learn their place.
Enemy bandits! Attack!
That should satisfy Ophis.
'Twas scarce a challenge.
Victory is ours! Let's bring word to<cf>Ophis.
As I recall, their leader kept a pet<cf>cyclops...
Perhaps we might win Ophis's favor<cf>through her pet?
Win the heart of Ophis's cyclops and we<cf>win its mistress's, too.
Tis a pet... There must be some method<cf>to win it to our side.
Perhaps we might win the brute over with<cf>food?
Some woman, to keep a cyclops for a<cf>pet...
I've ne'er known a cyclops to eat anything<cf>but meat.
Seems we've won the beast over.
We've tamed the cyclops.
Let's away, to meet with Ophis.
That should win us safe passage through<cf>the area.
We're a part of their company now.
Then that's the bandit chieftess's pet...<cf>Astonishing.
'Tis the lady thief's pet.<cf>Shall we lay food nearby it?
Slaying this cyclops would surely<cf>invoke the ire of Ophis.
We approach a den of thieves...'tis likely we'll<cf>see blood spilled.
There are thieves ahead, Master... If you aim<cf>to fight, I am at your side.
Here, Arisen.
What does it all mean, cousin?
You were hurt worse than most, but you seem hale as a whale, cos.
I'm fit to rival you in that, I'm happy to say.
I could hardly say the same were it not for your help, that's sure.
It will be a while yet before the clouds above Cassardis clear...
Myself, I fear I'm in no mood to smile.
You're awake! Oh, what a relief to see you well!
You were still as a stone for near two full days! We were so worried...
Maker be good, Quina's ministrations and my own curing herbs have brought you back to us.
What does it all mean, cousin?
With the dragon come and all, it's become dangerous around these parts.
Still, the woods outside the village should be safe. I'll go fetch another bundle of herbs.
What does it all mean, cousin?
Fretting's for the idle, says I.
I'm fit to rival you in that, I'm happy to say.

Oh! What are you doing... You came searching for me?
Forgive me. I would never wish to worry you.
But I had to come. A witch walks these woods -- one who understands the language of the dragon.
If I may find her, I will beg her aid in healing your wound.
Will you accompany me? This fog bodes ill... I would walk easier with you at my side.
The witch of these woods was once friend to our village.
But with the Faith's arrival, she fled here for fear of being branded heretic.
This fog confounds me... Is it always so in these woods?
It's as if the very air strains to block our path.
It's been an age since the witch last visited our village... In truth, I can't be certain she lives here still.
Yet even should we find her vanished, we must keep faith. There must be aught here. Some small clue...
I now know why they name this forest Witchwood, and not just after her we seek...
The villagers are right to fear this place.
You would leave? Very well. I will continue on just a bit longer.
There...that must be it. Come on, cos.
I do wish you would stay close.
Shall we?
Begging your pardon, but we seek the witch of these woods.
A great and aged woman? Perhaps you might have seen her?
Your grandmother? Yes.
Where might we find her? I would ask her aid in a dire matter.
Oh...
What of you, then? Know you aught of the dragon? Can you read the Wyrmspeak?
So... So your grandmother told you naught of the dragon, that the Faith might leave you be...
Then it seems we must turn to the Faith if we are to learn more. 
You have our thanks. We leave you in peace to return to our village.
Are you hurt?
M-my thanks...
Look out!
No, get back!
Yaa!
Oh!
Waugh!
Aaaaugh...
Hah!
Yaah!
Well, I trust?
Another time, perhaps?
Yes.
No.
Why, thank you.
You flatter me with your kindness, ser.
Mm? Oh, do not mind me. Just searching for aught, you see...
Nothing to do with you. Pray, move along, ser.
Hmmm... It must be hereabouts somewhere...
Perhaps the world is telling me to give up gracefully...
Magick, at its heart, is the transmutation of the user's mind into a physical force.
Its use requires a medium, namely the mage's own flesh. The brain and heart bear the greatest burden.
It taxes the body no less than wielding an axe or great sword, though many seem to view magi as a frailer sort.
Magick is potent stuff, and well useful, but the risks are dire. A single misstep, and the user's mind is forfeit.
Hence the long years of study spent on crafting ensorceled tools and talismans to control and direct the vast power being channeled.
Much thought and effort has gone into turning what is useful into that which is useable.
The study of magick is a chronicle of the history of human arrogance.
Too often, man is driven to acquire power beyond his control, and in so doing, delivers himself unto ruin.
'Twas a wise man said, "The fool who dons a cloak too long is like to stumble."
Man is apt to consider himself king among the beasts, elevated beyond their base and feral existence.
But where magick is concerned, the lesser beasts are masters. 'Tis my theory man is at a natural disadvantage.
While man is ever a jack-of-all-trades, a monster is driven with perfect focus by overriding instinct. That focus lends force to their magick. Do you not agree?
The wyrm is a subject of deepest interest...
It is possessed of strength and intellect in equal share, and a crystalline instinct to rival all other beasts, no doubt.
A perfect mage, truly. The power it must hold is beyond reckoning.
Magick is a grand pursuit. A fellow could study it all his life and still die ignorant of the better half of it.
'Tis a worthy subject to dedicate one's days to.
My thanks again for your aid in the matter of Salomet's grimoire. My body still trembles at the memory...
Seems I've quite an ear for danger as well, aye?
In days this dark, we must all be prepared to defend ourselves.
...As a scholar, I've learned aught from this whole experience.
Namely that, if you wish to see your good faith returned in kind, stay well clear of the Arisen.
Pray, be gone, ser. Leave me in peace.
There is naught to...naught to do but laugh!
Be this the work of the wyrm or of the Maker Himself, we stood no chance from the very start!
You flatter me with your kindness, ser.
The Maker welcomes you, traveler.
You must be the Arisen, he who commands the pawns.
Scripture speaks thus of the Arisen:
Go in peace, blessed traveler, for you walk toward the light even as you walk toward destruction.
The Maker ever watches over you on your way.
There are passages within the scripture that speak of the Arisen...
But no mention is made of the pawns.
In adherence with its teachings, the Faith does not recognize the pawn legion...
Though I bear them no ill will, I am barred from offering them the Maker's blessings.
Scripture tells that there is hope, amid the cycle of destruction.
"Though the dragon come without end, My world shall endure until time everlasting."
Even should we perish here in Gransys, life will go on elsewhere.
The Maker's creation endures.
The dragon has brought darkness to the land, this much is true.
But it has failed to bring utter destruction!
It is just as the scripture tells!
It's useless! We've not scratched its hide!
I hear old Fournival is the subject of an inquest.
His conviction would bring me no joy, not least for the loss in revenue I would suffer.
Arisen. I have a proposition, ser.
I've long had dealings with Fournival, and want to believe in his innocence.
Pray, take a petition for his acquittal from me, that it may help sway his arbiters.
I entrust my petition to you, Arisen.
I cannot afford to let old Fournival leave this mortal coil<cf>just yet...
'Tis locked. You haven't the key to fit it...
'Tis caught on something. Perhaps it could open from the far side.
'Tis barred shut. Might be able to break the bolt.
'Tis shut tight.
'Tis no use at this hour. You'll have to come again later.
Best stop for now.
Seems they're closed.
Someone was here...
Lost them...
Gone...
Perhaps you've upset them.
There's naught to do here.
Best you moved on.
Not here...
The door is closed.
Shows no sign of opening.
There's aught there...
You don't see anything.
That smell...
Someone's near...
What's this...?
Fine view from here.
There's aught written here...
Must be a way to find something...
Smells delicious.
Perfect spot to place something.
You can almost reach...
There appears to be aught ahead.
That fall could kill.
'Tis dangerous to touch.
A strong blow might break it.
Perhaps if you came by night.
Perhaps if you came by day.
Perhaps if you came at dawn.
Perhaps if you came at dusk.
There's aught buried here...
You see no way up.
'Tis slick, this spot.
No use pressing any further.
No need to double back further.
No time for that now.
You cannot carry any more.
There may yet be aught lying about.
Seems there's naught you can take on at present.<cf>Best to try again later.
Perhaps with a bit of help...
Best you kept your weapon sheathed.
Is someone here...?
'Tis a place for tall folk.
'Tis a place for small folk.
Had you a woman in your band...
Had you a man in your band...
Had you a strong companion...
Had you a swift companion...
Had you a magick user...
Had you an apt climber...
Had you a skilled jumper...
This weapon will not help you.
That armor won't protect you.
You're ill equipped for this.
Seems it can't be used now.
You'll get no further use from it.
'Tis useless, now.
Hmm, not with your current equipment...
Not with your current party...
You hear aught from further in.
Enemies... They're close.
Best you got some rest.
You can carry no more!
You're too exhausted!
"Danger! Keep Out!"
"No Trespassing"
A sign.
Had you an Empty Flask, you might fill it here.
You'll get no further without a lantern.
'Tis dangerous to fumble about in the dark. Best find a light.
Best not just leave them.
If aught were left here, it would rot.
Best take care you don't get lost.
Best check the map.
You're due for a rest.
This place is dangerous by night.
This place is dangerous by day.
Breathtaking...
You'll get no further!
Seems you'll need to come back.
Nothing left here.
It looks fit to crumble.
Seems it could be moved...
It will not budge.
It will not open.
Seems you need a key.
Seems you need a Pickaxe here.
You yet lack the experience.
You yet lack the skill.
Not with your current vocation...
You'll not pass through this gate.
You've no time!
Seems you were too late.
You may make it, yet.
You're doing well for time.
Seems you've come at the wrong time.
There may be another path.
The remains of an ox...
Naught you can do for this one...
'Tis a powerful weapon... Too bad it doesn't work.
Portcrystals work in tandem with<cf>Ferrystones.
Embed this Portcrystal in the ground any<cf>place save a dungeon, and you can use<cf>a Ferrystone to return there in an instant.
Be wary near any body of water. Wade too<cf>deep and you might be enveloped by the<cf>fog-like monster known as the Brine.
Wander too deep or idle too long in the<cf>water and you'll fall unconscious, washing<cf>ashore later at some faraway place. 
A Ferrystone will spirit you back to Gran<cf>Soren in an instant, no matter where you<cf>are located.
It is by far the fastest and safest method<cf>of travel, but each stone disappears after<cf>a single use.
You can equip yourself with a primary and<cf>a secondary weapon.
Primary weapons such as swords and daggers<cf>are combat essentials. Secondary weapons<cf>like bows and shields offer support.
In addition to weapons and armor, you can<cf>also equip accoutrements with certain special<cf>abilities to give you an edge in battle.
Only one piece of jewelry and a single<cf>cloak can be equipped as accoutrements<cf>at any one time.
A heavy load will cause your Stamina to<cf>deplete more quickly. Sell or discard<cf>any and all items you no longer need.
Your lantern consumes oil. If it dims,<cf>use a Flask of Oil to refill it.
Some items can be combined with others to<cf>produce surprising results. Experiment and<cf>see what you come up with. 
Place waypoint markers on your map to<cf>keep track of your progress.
If you've forgotten where you are in the story,<cf>select "Chronicle" from the Pause Menu to<cf>review a history of your journey thus far.
Select "Options" from the Pause Menu to<cf>customize your mini-map and status display.
The higher the fall, the more damage you<cf>will suffer.
Note that you move somewhat slower while<cf>your weapon is drawn.
Exhausting all Stamina will make you unable<cf>to act for a time. Take care to conserve<cf>energy!
You can attack while clinging to foes.
Petrifaction cannot be cured by normal<cf>magick, and is fatal if left untreated.
Use Secret Softener or the like to<cf>cure any petrified allies.
Your rank within a vocation rises as you<cf>defeat foes and complete quests. At higher<cf>ranks, a broader variety of skills are available.
Defeating foes and completing quests earns<cf>you more discipline, boosting your prowess<cf>in a vocation.
Pawns will collect and use items of their<cf>own volition.
You cannot carry or purchase items that<cf>would cause you to exceed your maximum<cf>encumbrance.
Press <TUTO><SIZE 25><ICON TOUCH></SIZE> while climbing down a ladder<cf>to descend quickly. 
If a pawn remains unconscious for too long,<cf>they will be forfeit.
Your support pawn has become forfeit, and<cf>returned to the realm whence they came.
Your main pawn has become forfeit,<cf>disappearing and returning to the rift.
You cannot join covenants with other pawns<cf>while your main pawn is forfeit.
Touch any riftstone to return your lost<cf>main pawn to your side.
If a support pawn is forfeit, any items<cf>they were carrying are sent to item storage.
You can send off departing pawns with a<cf>single item as a gift for their creator.
You can pass items to and from your pawns<cf>on the sub menu.
Why are you here!?
Piss off!
Who d'you fancy you are?
You're not welcome here.
We don't suffer trespassers.
Eager to die, friend?
Be off with you!
You're daft, friend.
The life of an Arisen must be awfully boring.
Still here, are you?
How do you fare?
Hoy!
Those rotten...
'Tis a poor jest...
...Truly?
We ought to have finished them earlier.
We'll do for them, we will...
Aye, we will...
What?
I see...
And what then?
The merchant folk have hired me to carve deeper into this place, though to what end I cannot fathom.
'Tis madness, coming to a place where monsters are like to appear at any moment.
You're free to head deeper in, if you've the inclination. There may be treasures there to rival the dangers, but I'm content with a day's wage and my head attached.
I can scarce believe it. Arisen...
Don't let the rat escape!
Hnh.
Gaugh...
Graaugh...
Hup.
Rragh!
Hoy, goodfisher!
Take care.
Aye.
No, cousin.
Kind of you.
Thanks, cos!
Was there aught you needed?
Can this wait?
Have a look!
Take your time, cos.
That one, is it?
Always a pleasure.
Come back soon, eh?
That's not quite enough, cos.
How does this strike you?
I'll keep it safe.
Here.
Aye, I'll bite.
That I cannot do.
No man can hasten the tide, eh?
The world is gone mad, cousin.
Working the sea leaves little time for fretting.
All right, what next?
Steady on, goodfisher.
'Tis madness, pure and simple...
Have a look!
Thanks, cos!
At long last, aid arrives! 'Twas quite a wait, ser.
The leader of those zealots made for the floor above.
There's a passage here will take you there more quickly. I'll open it.
Yes, tongues wag with talk of Madeleine.
Rumor has it she was dealing in illicit goods...
Some authority uncovered her game, and she was forced to shutter her shop.
I hear she fled, too, afore the guards had a chance to arrest her.
Just what was she up to, I'd like to know...
This way leads on to the encampment.
Seems this way leads outside as well.
Set out from here and we'll be on<cf>the path to the Windbluff Tower.
Another passage extends beyond,<cf>Arisen.
'Tis said a mysterious door lies ahead...
We'll like find shops selling<cf>weapons and sundries within.
The city has amenities for every need.<cf>Armorers, apothecaries, an inn to rest...
The Pawn Guild stands ahead. 'Tis a<cf>gathering place for my kind.
This place holds its share of shadows...<cf>We'll like find all manner of shop here.
Seems that many people live here,<cf>as well.
Those without a trade or the means<cf>to earn a wage live here.
An armorer, I believe.
We're like to have dealings with the<cf>armorer here for some time to come.
We can take on curatives and other<cf>supplies for our journey here.
'Tis not the last we'll call upon<cf>this inn, I'll warrant.
Aye, the inn offers a clean bed, but<cf>it deals in vocations and skills, besides.
Hm? 'Tis a barber's shop.
This shop will see to your hair, should<cf>you be of a mind to have it styled.
This must be an alehouse.
Many's the person comes to drink<cf>here, all bearing different tales.
So this is the Pawn Guild...
You can summon pawns as necessity<cf>demands here at the Pawn Guild.
Hmm... This shop bears a rather<cf>unwholesome look to it...
The scrivener at The Black Cat here can<cf>duplicate objects in your possession.
This city has a church as well?
Gran Soren's cathedral is a<cf>handsome structure.
Beyond those gates lies the duke's<cf>castle, I'd warrant.
My kind are not permitted to enter the<cf>castle gates. Pray, forgive me, Arisen.
Seems the castle walls are reached<cf>by a flight of stairs ahead.
The stairs ahead lead atop the<cf>castle walls.
These stairs serve as a useful<cf>route in their own right.
Seems a path runs along the top of<cf>the castle walls.
Mind the guards on watch. They'll not<cf>suffer any untoward behavior lightly.
One can see the whole of the city<cf>from here.
Speak to any pawn and they will<cf>gladly join your service, Arisen.
Seems this is where the merchants<cf>live. 'Tis quite open.
So quiet...
A smithy, I should think.
I suppose the merchants have need<cf>of open space to ply their trades.
Feed for livestock, no doubt.
What meaning do you suppose those<cf>stones hold?
'Tis a portcrystal. With a ferrystone,<cf>you could reach it from anywhere.
This leads on to the cathedral and<cf>the rest of the upper district.
The duke's castle stands in this<cf>quarter as well.
Many of these are like to be homes<cf>of members of the duke's court.
Stunning structures, are they not?<cf>Homes to knights and chamberlains.
This door opens on the area near<cf>the Pawn Guild.
Most of the doors are barred tight...<cf>For fear of the dragon, perhaps.
Seems this house is open.
A ladder, Master.
That ladder will see us to the roof.
We may be able to cross from roof<cf>to roof, Arisen.
Some corners of the capital can only<cf>be reached by crossing the rooftops.
I suspect we can enter here, Arisen.
Naught beats a rooftop for a<cf>vantage on the city's hidden corners.
Mind the height of the fall if you<cf>aim to jump down, Arisen.
This inn can serve as the hub of our<cf>journeys.
Here we can rest, manage inventory<cf>and skills, and so on.
Armorers trade in a wide variety of<cf>weapons and defensive equipment.
Also, some weapons can be further<cf>enhanced with their aid.
Precious things gone lost or missing<cf>have a way of turning up there.
What's more, the proprietor can<cf>furnish forgeries of certain items.
'Tis a Portcrystal, Master.
The barber keeps abreast of the latest<cf>tonsorial trends, if you fancy a cut.
Even my kind enjoy a new coiffure<cf>from time to time.
Patrons oft post work notices in the<cf>alehouse.
Duke Edmun Dragonsbane is a hero.<cf>He slew the wyrm a generation past.
'Tis said he was named duke afore his<cf>cavalcade reached Gran Soren's gates.
Even now, the people worship him as<cf>their savior.
Under his guidance, Gransys has<cf>known peace and prosperity.
Now, with a new dragon come, his focus<cf>is turned to bolstering her defenses.
The Enlistment Corps scours the land<cf>for soldiers to man the frontier holds.
Bards the land over sing of his<cf>exploits...albeit in the broadest terms.
It seems no one knows just how he<cf>managed to defeat the beast.
The pawns that fought alongside him<cf>must be about somewhere...
But where, this pawn cannot say.
I suppose it takes grander things<cf>than bronze to win her heart.
That seemed to satisfy her.
She was more pleased at that<cf>golden idol than I'd imagined.
She seemed happier even than I'd expected.
He was well glad to have the tome.
...Was this the right choice?
I fear you've made a friend of her.
At least she found some diversion today.
A sorry result, given the pains we took.
We made it... Thank goodness.
We were too late...
The two are reunited... You've done a<cf>proud service here, Master.
'Tis a joy to see them smiling.
You're wounded! What has happened,<cf>Arisen!?
Master, you're hurt! How did this<cf>happen!?
Someone in the castle must be<cf>the "Night's Champion," but who?
Rumor has it Salvation works with a<cf>man known as the Night's Champion...
Salvation, and the Night's Champion...<cf>The capital swirls with ill rumors.
Salvation is on the tongues of<cf>everyone, from peasant to noble.
As expected of a residential area,<cf>'tis much more quiet.
This is a place quite restful to my kind.
Be they man or pawn,<cf>'tis hard to do aught alone.
Are your travel preparations complete?
You humans certainly do make<cf>a lot of expressions.
All these workers going about<cf>their business... How lively.
A place one can live without fear<cf>of monsters!
From day to night, this area feels<cf>completely different.
I wonder if there are rarities from<cf>abroad.
'Tis dreadfully easy to while away<cf>hours just shopping.
I'd imagine one would never<cf>tire of this place.
'Tis usually more lively.
Remember to save enough for lodging.
Once our preparations are complete, we<cf>ought meet with Chamberlain Aldous.
We've done it!
Steady on!
Now, where shall we head?
Your different countries, cities,<cf>people... Intriguing.
Remember to both buy and<cf>sell items regularly.
The life of a salesman surely has<cf>its own trials.
Have you aught to sell?
Have you equipment to enhance?
The guards do have much to worry on...
Ought we adjust our inventory?
You're keeping busy, eh? I hear there's aught on with the well?
If you've cause to handle a flame, pray, be careful. For all the water down there, the paths are narrow.
Take more care still if you mean to bring oil with you. Shower a bit of oil on it, and fire will take to just about anything.
You'll remember, won't you? I do not want to see you hurt.
I'll do all I can for His Grace an' this fine land.
What's a few monsters before warriors like you an' me, eh?
Remind me why I shouldn't kill you again?
Do you need something? Like a kick to the teeth?
Could you do me a favor, and piss off?
Your survival instinct is terribly low.
I reckon we have absolutely nothing to talk about.
Is the full extent of an Arisen's powers being bothersome?
No one likes a busybody...least of all, me.
Ye-e-e-s?
Good to see you, friend!
Come to help us plunder?
What do you think you're doing here?
...Why are you still in my presence?
What is your problem, friend?
May I have no respite from you?
I love intruders. Gives me a chance to work on my bladework.
Don't think I won't take the opportunity to put you in your<cf>place.
How can I be free of this clouted barnacle!?
I'd wager your head is even harder than my steel.
If all work were as slack as Arisening must be, I might've kept a legal job!
You may be the most mule-headed person I've ever met.
How go your travails?
Hallo!
Audacious harlots...spawned from the dragon himself!
This really is the last straw, this time.
...For true?
Now...now is the time to strike, for true and for all.
'Tis merely a question of how, when, and where...
Mm-hmm...
What?
Understood...
Then?
To your health.
His Grace must have a reason for such frivolity...
I find it difficult to enjoy such a gathering in such dire times.
I wish you luck, ser.
Pray, calm yourself.
The water's fairly deep. Mind your lantern<cf>stays dry.
'Tis quite the waterway. I wonder where it<cf>leads?
A sewer used in times long past, perhaps.
I've heard the talk. You're the Arisen, eh?
Quite the honor to be employed by the duke himself.
They're putting steel in the hand of every able-bodied man in the duchy, no doubt you've seen.
Even so, it may prove too little. Considering the foe, no force is too large.
I do not ken what magick you Arisen work to control the pawns, nor do I care to.
Just the same, you're a useful lot when there's need for able hands.
Well, keep it up.
I'd hoped the Greatwall, at least, might be spared in this mess.
The wall is the linchpin of Gransys' defense, manned with some of our finest.
Still, what is a man to do before a dragon? Even the bravest<cf>champion is still just a piece of meat...
Then the dragon is truly returned?
I had hoped the beast would rot away where it slept.
Our current force is no match for it, that much is clear.
Perhaps it's time to set out for greener pastures...
If you feel you must go face the wyrm, I'll not dissuade you.
But should you run, I daresay no man would judge you craven.
I smell goblin...
The goblins came this way...
'Tis dark... Have you a light?
'Tis hard to see in this darkness.
I fear we'll find something<cf>waiting for us...
The gate stands open, but I am loath to simply walk in...
We're trapped...!
Was this the goblins' plan all along?
Look at the size of it...!<cf>No way this was built for use by men.
What would require a gate of this size?
Impressive craftsmanship,<cf>especially given the location.
We'll need a way through the gate<cf>to get at the treasure.
Quite imposing, this place...
To think such a venue lay hidden<cf>underground...
Who built this chamber? 'Tis not<cf>the work of nature alone...
Take care. From here on, the<cf>caves swarm with goblins.
The goblins' stockpile must be close.<cf>Leave no corner unsearched.
I am she that ends all things.
Ngh!
Uooh!
Yaaaah...
Nf.
Hya!
Hee hee...
Till next time.
Sure.
Mmm...
Thank you.
Oh, thank you so much.
What? The expense of such a... Your kindness is too much to bear.
Thank you. I love it. Truly.
You should be abed. I wish you would not strain yourself so.
I worry for you, cos.
The chief says your injury could be a curse from the dragon.
If so, that's not something I know how to heal.
But there must be a way...
You were not the only one to suffer the wrath of the wyrm, cos.
There were many wounded.
Others... Some were not so fortunate.
The whole village was worried about you. They'd be well relieved<cf>to see you up and about.
Perhaps you might go and see the others, if you feel well enough.
You fight for this village, and here I sit with my hands at my sides!
I feel so very helpless.
I tremble to think what the dragon might have wrought, without your brave defiance.
Our village, burned to a cinder, or swept to sea like so much driftwood...
We...we all of us appreciate your sacrifice.
Praise the Maker your home was left standing.
Though I'm pleased to say most the damage caused by the attack has been mended by now.
We've buried our new dead at the church.
Spare them a final prayer, won't you?
I fear we know precious little of your condition...
I only ask you not take your wellness as license for wildness.<cf>Be careful.
It warms my heart to see those who fled the dragon even now return.
How fares your wound? Does it still trouble you?
The chief is worried... He reasons you mean to leave the village...
I think much on the wound the dragon gave you.
Sometimes, when night comes and sleep escapes me, I fear it<cf>has...changed you, somehow.
I know it is folly, but I cannot help myself.
If ever you do leave the village, I will look upon that wound as the cause.
Benita told me of the flowers you gathered for the wounded.
You are kind as ever, cos.
Sometimes I feel like a ship against the current...
I swore to heal your wound, yet I feel I know less now than when I started.
I can't stand idly by while you risk all to save us!
There must be some way I might aid you, if only a little.
How fares your wound? You seem better than before.
Have you been toiling in Gran Soren all this time?
I could listen to your tales from first light to final candle! I only wish I could be more of a help...
To hear Ser Auster tell it...
The Faith has dedicated its efforts to learning all that can be known of the dragon.
Most of the Faith's findings have yet to reach our ears. They're too busy with their studies to send word to the likes of Cassardis, I'm sure...
Perhaps a visit to the Grand Cathedral on the mainland would yield the clues we seek?
I must learn more of your vile wound...
Perhaps the forest witch would know something.
I thought to find you here.
They speak of you in every corner of the capital. They say the Arisen has returned.
I need learn of the dragon, and your wound as well.
And so I came seeking aid for your condition.
I spoke of you to the Faith, but they had no aid to give.
It seems my only hope is to pray. And I fear the Maker only answers such in His own time.
Unlike some, you've taken the role of Arisen to heart, no?
Well, I'll not be outdone. If this is to be my role, I shall fill it with all that I am.
I wish to complete my training to the end, and do so without assistance.
I cannot beg help while you strive to save the world entire.
Please... Let me do as I must.
I...I tried to find the witch in the woods...
I had hoped she might know more of the wound you bear.
A thick fog blanketed the forest, swallowing my path at every turn. I was never able to find the witch.
I wish to complete my training to the end, and do so without assistance.
I cannot beg help while you strive to save the world entire.
Please... Let me do as I must.
'Tis plain to see you're busy...
I hear naught but ill rumors...
Men speak whispers that Arisen are simply fodder for<cf>the dragon...
Whispers that you act as a sacrifice for others who hope to gauge the beast's strength.
They say you're naught but a tool, just as the pawns.
The rumors say you are played for a fool. By the duke. By the dragon. By some other force, even more powerful and sinister...
I hear these things and I...I know not how to respond.
It's as if dark fingers clench themselves around my heart.
Arisen or hero or neither, it's no concern to me...
My only wish is to see you back to us safely.
I hear you serve at the pleasure of His Grace now?
You seem...different. The playmate of my youth given way to a hero of legend...
You drift from me like a ship to the horizon. And I fear that one day you will slip over the other side, and disappear forever...
I imagine you will be tasked to face the dragon ere long.
The wyrm's awakening changed the whole world. Yet I cannot help but think it affected us above all others.
Does that sound vain? I do not mean it so. 
You struggle against more than a dragon; you pull on the very threads of fate itself.
All has changed, never to return as it was.
Y-you met the dragon? And yet, you live...
You would duel the beast... I can see it in your eyes.
...Don't. To face the dragon is folly!
I care not they name you Arisen! I care not what powers, what magicks you possess...
No man can hope to stare down that creature and live...
I remember cradle tales of the Arisen. Not all their kind did battle with the dragon. There must be some other means...
You have a choice. You need not trod a path leading to doom.
...I could rail like a priest from the pulpit, but to what end?
You will fight the dragon.
I suppose I may take some small solace at your conviction to face the wyrm.
Such is your nature, and there's no struggle in the face of it.
Th-the dragon is vanquished? For true!? 
Oh, happiest of days!
To think you could best the great wyrm... It sets my mind<cf>to reel.
You saved all the land from certain destruction...
I have not the words to thank you. 
You have become what all hoped of you...
A hero true.
A hole... A gateway to another world...
Whatever awaits, you were destined to face it.
You will find what you seek in the depths of that chasm. I am sure of it. 
I know not your fate, or the powers all you now possess -- but I know my feelings for you are true. 
I shall wait for you. Now and forever, what else may come. I shall wait for you.
A chasm to another world?
Is that maw the root of all the dark times of late?
I hoped your duty as Arisen would end with the dragon's defeat...
But it seems destiny holds yet more for you.
I feared you would not return when first you set on your journey, but my doubts proved false.
Yet now a new threat rises, and I must face such worries anew.
Swear you will do all you can to come back to us...
We are your friends, your family. And this is your home.
Swear you will do all you can to come back to us...
We are your friends, your family. And this is your home.
By the Maker! You walk with pawns now?
But they don't consort with normal folk...
It's strange the things I missed. The scent of the ocean. The sound of waves on the shore... I...I shall never neglect to appreciate them again.
I believe I understand now. When the dragon gave you that wound, it wasn't to harm you...
It was marking you as chosen. A sign you were fated for great things...
This world but spins in a great circle, for all eternity.
Your struggle against the dragon is simply one arc in that circle.
In truth, I care not for fate, or heroism, or whatever deeper purpose you were meant to serve.
You saved my life... It is a debt I can never repay.
A friend of Quina's, are you?
As I imagine you know, she is now one of us, training here at the abbey.
'Tis her ardent wish to travel to the Great Cathedral to learn of the dragon.
All for you, no doubt.
Quina presently trains in the blessing of flowers.
An educated eye can gauge the talent she possesses from a glance at her flowers.
If a brother from one of our neighboring churches and I agree all that she has the gift, she may well have her wish.
I would write the letter recommending her to the Great Cathedral myself, were I convinced.
Is... Is this one of Quina's flowers!?
No, surely not. To imbue the bloom with such energy, after such a short time...
'Tis enough to make me doubt my senses. Pray, have the priest in Gran Soren or Cassardis take a look.
In truth, she may yet pass the Great Cathedral's gates earlier than not.
'Tis enough to make me doubt my senses. Pray, have the priest in Gran Soren or Cassardis take a look.
If this is truly her work, she may yet pass the Great Cathedral's gates earlier than not...
I do not... Cannot doubt Quina's talents after what we have seen.
In truth, she may yet pass the Great Cathedral's gates earlier than not.
Decided, Arisen?
Good fortune be upon you.
Understood.
I thank you.
I could hardly be happier.
Yes.
No.
I fear you haven't enough, ser...
Pray, forgive me.
My mistress oft said the Arisen ought give charity, but never take it... I am sorry.
Arisen...I am honored to make your acquaintance. <cf>This pawn is known as Johnathan. I am a<cf>collector of items from other realms.
All that I have, I am willing to offer you. <cf>I only ask a small payment of rift crystals in return.
I attempt to seek out rarities, so please take a look... <cf>Surely you'll find something of use.
If you would trade rift crystals for goods, you need but ask.<cf>This pawn's sole desire is to aid you, Arisen.
This pawn shall assist you to the best of my ability, Arisen.
I pray you will see my mistress's dreams realized.
The hopes of my fallen mistress go with you... I pray you will be the one to grant her rest.
<RMSH>Choose as you will, ser.
Buy
Never mind
I am ever at your service.
I thank you.
I am ever at your service.
Good fortune be upon you.
<EQRM>Choose as you will, ser.
Buy
Change equipment
Never mind
I could hardly be happier.
The man's clearly through...
What!?
So Fournival is to stand trial?
I cannot say it surprises me. I overheard him speaking with one of the duke's ministers...
'Twas a clandestine dealing, far departed from legitimate trade. A bit of smuggling, perhaps.
I am in your debt, Arisen. Mayhap this is aught I can do to repay you.
Pray, take me to Gran Soren with you.
I shall gladly take the stand if it means bringing his crimes to light.
'Twould be a pleasure to restore some scrap of order to this world gone mad.
Please, ser. See me to the capital, that I may help justice be done.
Accept
Not now
My thanks, Arisen! May the Maker speed our steps.
I see... I'd thought it a welcome chance to repay my debt, but I'll not press the matter.
I still feel I ought to go see Fournival's crimes made public, ser.
I ask again: Will you escort me to the capital?
Accept
Not now
To the capital, then. I shall follow you.
I've no stomach for fighting...
Let's choose a safe path, aye?
W-wait, ser!
Do you aim to be rid of me?
Pray, take care of yourself, ser...
You must hold on!
I...fear I can...go no further...
Have we the time for such distractions, ser?
Ngh!
Oof!
Aaaaagh...
Yah!
Hahh!
Hello.
If you'll excuse me.
Yes.
Well...
Thank you.
I could hardly be happier.
I could hardly be happier.
Much time has passed since first I came to wander this place.
There have been many like you. Children of man, drawn down below their rightful sphere...
This way leads out afield.
We can leave for the encampment this<cf>way.
Seems a fair place to rest.
Why not avail yourself of the inn to<cf>rest awhile, Arisen?
So many beds...
Seems these rooms are frequented by<cf>peddlers and the like.
They've wares to sell here.
It seems this place deals in arms<cf>and general supplies.
Do you suppose this dried fish keeps<cf>long?
Word is, the fishmonger here is also<cf>learned in medicinal herbs.
The produce looks quite fresh.
Appears this grocer is responsible<cf>for much of the village's provisions.
Such vivid colors...
Seems they trade in textiles, though<cf>I'm not certain they're open...
Mm...a delicious aroma.
Quite the din rises from the alehouse.<cf>My kind ne'er engage in drunken revels.
Ah, the village chapel.
A lovely chapel, served by a dedicated<cf>priest, from what they say.
My kind knows neither death nor age.<cf>'Tis likely one reason humans shun us.
Is this the chief's dwelling, then?
Have people of Cassardis always held<cf>their meetings in the chief's home?
Quite tidy, this room.
Quina's room bears such a pleasant<cf>scent.
Is this...your home, Arisen?
'Tis well peaceful, this place. It<cf>seems Quina keeps it tidy.
A lookout post, is it?
I suppose the villagers take turns<cf>standing watch.
The sea appears calm, at least.
Take care at the water's edge, Master!
Linger in the water overlong and the<cf>Brine may come for you.
Dried fish are a local staple.
I'll warrant there's aught to be<cf>found along the coast ahead.
Many boats, just as you'd expect for<cf>a fishing village.
A fine spot to fish, no doubt.
Why do you suppose the well is sealed?
Something about this well<cf>seems...wrong.
It seems the dragon left many<cf>injured in its wake.
One could walk most the village<cf>across the rooftops...
Perhaps there's aught to be found<cf>lost atop the village roofs.
I see a chest of some sort -- there,<cf>by the cliffs.
There's treasure to be found by the cliffs.<cf>Perhaps we may reach it from above?
Seems a fine spot to harvest materials.
This place is fit for harvest... I'd not<cf>expected such bounty here in the village.
What say you, Arisen? Fancy the<cf>thought of jumping from here?
Another room...?
There is another room here.
A cave...
A small cave lies beyond. We might<cf>mine it for ore.
Are you certain we ought to enter<cf>someone's home unbidden?
Before leaving, visit the store to<cf>make sure you've ample supplies.
From day to night, this area feels<cf>completely different.
Do watch your funds.
The life of a salesman surely has<cf>its own trials.
You humans certainly do make<cf>a lot of expressions.
Have you aught to sell?
'Tis usually more lively.
Try not to be too much of a bother...
As expected of a residential area,<cf>'tis much more quiet.
Masterfully done!
This is a place quite restful to my kind.
To think, nowadays goods circulate<cf>across all of Gransys...
Are your travel preparations complete?
Remember to both buy and<cf>sell items regularly.
Now, where shall we head?
Waaaugh!
Craven! You aim to flee!?

Oh, yes!
Hmm, I don't know...
Oh, thank you!
'Tis the best day of my life! Thank you!
Such a strange feeling, really...
Such a strange feeling, really...
All the things I'd given up on suddenly seem possible anew...
Thank you, Arisen!
I ought thank my father as well.
I hear talk the world is in a dire spot, but my father and I will muddle through together, I know.
There's naught could've been done. We can't well wall off the sky.
Everything felt so bright and new...so full of hope, but now...
If living means facing a world like this, I... I don't know...
'Tis the best day of my life! Thank you!

Fournival's tenants are somewhere within<cf>Gran Soren.
Let's find this Jasper fellow.
Jasper won't have left the capital.
Where do you suppose we'll find<cf>Sara and Pip?
Sara must be within the capital<cf>somewhere.
I suspect we'll find Sara in the<cf>square.
Sara's like to have gathered her thoughts<cf>by now.
Perhaps Sara has changed her thinking...
We've secured their consent. Let's speak<cf>to Jasper.
Sara and Pip have been persuaded.<cf>'Tis time to see Jasper.
Let's speak with Pip.
We'd best try to convince young Pip.
Now we need only convince young Pip.
Pip must be somewhere nearby.
We're like to find Pip in the<cf>Craftsman's Quarter.
Might Pip be in the Craftsman's<cf>Quarter, Master?
Young Pip is near the aqueducts,<cf>like as not.
Might Pip be hiding around the<cf>aqueducts, Master?
Perhaps the boy is shy? Let's speak with<cf>him again.
Now we need only convince Sara.
We best devote ourselves to gathering<cf>that coin.
'Tis a considerable sum.<cf>Best we begin now.
A fine resolution! Should we bring this<cf>news to Jasper?
Jasper and his kin will be pleased.
Let's hasten back to Fournival.
We have their consent. Let's bring word<cf>to Fournival.
We must seize young Pip as one would<cf>a foe, ere he give us the slip. 
Perhaps we ought simply buy the land<cf>from Fournival and be done with it.

If it isn't the Arisen... What brings you to such a place, ser?
Myself, I've come to rest from my travels, though it seems I've chosen the wrong place for a leisurely stroll.
That slate you carry... Looks like aught of value, or scholarly interest, at the least.
If you want those strange writings read, you'd best seek a man of letters. A priest, perhaps.
Helping the masses is their calling, after all. You'll likely get your information, and free of cost, at that.
'Twould be my pleasure to help you myself, though I fear my rates are a bit higher. ...No? As you like, then.
Why not bring that slate to a man of the cloth, ser? Might be they could decipher it.
Don't let me keep you. I've a mind to rest here a while longer...
'Tis locked. You haven't the key to fit it...
'Tis caught on something. Perhaps it could open from the far side.
'Tis barred shut. Might be able to break the bolt.
'Tis shut tight.
'Tis no use at this hour. You'll have to come again later.
Best stop for now.
Seems they're closed.
Someone was here...
Lost them...
Gone...
Perhaps you've upset them.
There's naught to do here.
Best you moved on.
Not here...
The door is closed.
Shows no sign of opening.
There's aught there...
You don't see anything.
That smell...
Someone's near...
What's this...?
Fine view from here.
There's aught written here...
Must be a way to find something...
Smells delicious.
Perfect spot to place something.
You can almost reach...
There appears to be aught ahead.
That fall could kill.
'Tis dangerous to touch.
A strong blow might break it.
Perhaps if you came by night.
Perhaps if you came by day.
Perhaps if you came at dawn.
Perhaps if you came at dusk.
There's aught buried here...
You see no way up.
'Tis slick, this spot.
No use pressing any further.
No need to double back further.
No time for that now.
You cannot carry any more.
There may yet be aught lying about.
Seems there's naught you can take on at present.<cf>Best to try again later.
Perhaps with a bit of help...
Best you kept your weapon sheathed.
Is someone here...?
'Tis a place for tall folk.
'Tis a place for small folk.
Had you a woman in your band...
Had you a man in your band...
Had you a strong companion...
Had you a swift companion...
Had you a magick user...
Had you an apt climber...
Had you a skilled jumper...
This weapon will not help you.
That armor won't protect you.
You're ill equipped for this.
Seems it can't be used now.
You'll get no further use from it.
'Tis useless, now.
Hmm, not with your current equipment...
Not with your current party...
You hear aught from further in.
Enemies... They're close.
Best you got some rest.
You can carry no more!
You're too exhausted!
"Danger! Keep Out!"
"No Trespassing"
A sign.
Had you an Empty Flask, you might fill it here.
You'll get no further without a lantern.
'Tis dangerous to fumble about in the dark. Best find a light.
Best not just leave them.
If aught were left here, it would rot.
Best take care you don't get lost.
Best check the map.
You're due for a rest.
This place is dangerous by night.
This place is dangerous by day.
Breathtaking...
You'll get no further!
Seems you'll need to come back.
Nothing left here.
It looks fit to crumble.
Seems it could be moved...
It will not budge.
It will not open.
Seems you need a key.
Seems you need a Pickaxe here.
You yet lack the experience.
You yet lack the skill.
Not with your current vocation...
You'll not pass through this gate.
You've no time!
Seems you were too late.
You may make it, yet.
You're doing well for time.
Seems you've come at the wrong time.
There may be another path.
'Tis fallen to ruin... You'll ne'er get through it.
'Tis a powerful weapon... Too bad it doesn't work.

Exhausting all Stamina will make you unable<cf>to act for a time. Take care to conserve<cf>energy!
You can attack while clinging to foes.
Petrifaction cannot be cured by normal<cf>magick, and is fatal if left untreated.
Use Secret Softener or the like to<cf>cure any petrified allies.

You can pass items to and from your pawns<cf>on the sub menu.
You're persistent! ...I hate that.
Ye-e-e-ss?
My apologies, I can't talk to you right now. Or ever.
Leave now, and I'll even let you keep your bones intact!
Pray, don't go thinking you're actually worth something.
Poor baby! People are mean to you!
Run along and play elsewhere.
Do you have need of something? Other than to let me alone?
Looks like you've mettle after all.
Be at ease, you're among friends.
Arisen! This way, ser!
We'd hidden away here, for fear of the beasts<cf>all around...
But with you, ser...we have a chance.
Our army is routed. 'Tis plain truth.
We can but pin our hopes to you, now.
The wyrm awaits beyond, ser. I should be proud to guide you.
Beyond that grand door, the dragon makes its<cf>roost.
Let's get this over with.
Graaaaugh!
There's talk of revolt in the north. Won't say I cannot understand the impulse...
Manning a desolate stronghold that just as like serves no use in staying the dragon is mean work.
There's only so much fear and idleness a man can take. Especially on those meager wages.
So I'm discovered at last... You must believe me -- I've done nothing wrong!
They say I dealt in banned goods...
If it's true, I swear, it was not my intent! I had no idea...
But as I don't expect them to take me at my word, I was forced into hiding. 
I fled in such haste, all my goods were left behind. More's the pity, I suppose.
Wish I'd thought to secure my dagger. It's a kind of charm what brings good fortune, you see.
Maker's breath! That's...that's my dagger!
Oh, you beautiful thing! I can hardly believe it! I could just kiss you!
Return her dagger
Refuse

Wish I'd thought to secure my dagger. It's a kind of charm what brings good fortune, you see.
It's been with me since my first days peddling turnips. Without it I feel...not myself.
What a fool, to leave it in my own shop! Mostlike I'll never see the old thing again...
But then, I've greater concerns at the moment.
I've never seen trouble the likes of this. Even now I feel the tears welling...
It took all of my will and every last bit of gold to see that shop opened, and now... 
If you hadn't found me, I don't know what I'd do...
Hmm...?
No! Soldiers!
You...you saved me. Thank you.
As Arisen, I suspect lying does not come easy... I'm sorry to've asked it of you.
I can tarry no longer. I must seek safety somewhere further off.
I'm at peace with the loss of my shop and merchandise; such things can be replaced.
But parting from you is a blow far more cruel. What? I speak from the heart!
It shames me to ask for more, when you have given so much, yet...
Might you spare some gold for my travels? My hasty departure left me without a single coin to my name.
<R_G>If all goes well, I shall pay you back in full. Most likely. ...Eventually. 
Offset her travel expenses (<NOTE>50,000</NOTE>G)
Refuse
You...you saved me. Thank you.
But you have little talent in the art of deception, Arisen. Perhaps you should spend more time with me.

Give her a little gold
Refuse
Thank you. You show such kindness to this foolish girl, and I...I love you for it.
Once I am safely away, I'll establish a new shop in whatever place my travels take me.
And when my purse jingles once again, I shall track you down and repay my debt. Truly!
Well, I suppose that's not entirely unexpected.
It would be a job in itself to repay you, besides. What with you gallivanting about the land and all.
Well, I must be off.
I must say, before leaving Cassardis with you, my life was utterly hopeless.
But see how far I've come. I even had a shop of my own, if only for a moment. I can take pride in that.
And as this adventure failed to kill me, perhaps I may even learn aught from it... Or not.
I know not what fortune holds for you, Arisen, but I trust it will be terrifically exciting. 
Please don't die. Promise me you'll come see me in my next shop.
Fare well, Arisen.
In any case, I should be off.
Fortune and moxie have taken me this far; I'm sure they will see me the rest of the way.
Perhaps I'll even happen upon another someone to aid me. 
You know, same as how you appeared in Cassardis when I needed you most.
Thank you again, and fare well.
I must say, before leaving Cassardis with you, my life was positively the worst thing ever.
But see how far I've come. I even had a shop of my own, if only for a moment. I can take pride in that.
And as this adventure failed to kill me, perhaps I may even learn aught from it... Or not.
Fair travels to you.
Maker's breath! That's...that's my dagger!
Oh, you beautiful thing! I can hardly believe it! I could just kiss you!
Give her the dagger
Keep it
I have not the words to thank you.
It's been at my side ere I started my trade, many moons ago.
What!? ...You are cruel to taunt me so!
...And yet, I cannot hold it against you.
You saved me from the Guard when you might have consigned me to chains.
A dagger is a fair exchange for a life, no? Only do be careful with it. It's near a part of me. 
You...you saved me. Thank you.
But have you been told just how poor a liar you make?
I'd always taken you for a bit dim, but Maker's breath! What were you thinking?
I planned to rescue you later.
I thought we'd flee while they were distracted.
I grant you, hindsight is a fool's sport...
But what manner of plan is that!? I expect more from an Arisen, certainly.
I might suspect luck alone drove the dragon from Cassardis, if I didn't know better of it.
Ah, well. All's done and over now.
Thank you for what aid you provided. I must be off.
I grant you, hindsight is a fool's sport...
But I thought the Arisen to have a more...clever scheme in mind.
Ah, well. All's done and over now.
Thank you for what aid you provided. I must be off.
Oh, but hold. Allow me to demonstrate the proper execution of a clever scheme...
Right, there we are. Fare well!
The ring, it's...it's for me? Truly?
I fear to even speak, lest my love for you o'erwhelm all common decency.
'Twas destiny brought us together. I know this for true.
A most unsettling noise comes from the well of late.
'Tis half a growl and half a laugh... Most unsettling.

Took longer than I'd thought.
We're too few! Fall back, all of you!
Griffins on the main roads... A man can't leave his house without mortal danger any more!
Hail, Arisen. Out for a walk to clear your head as well? Else on some manner of watch?
I hear the streets have emptied since the dragon's coming. I oft wonder what this place was like before.
Would my own country grow so bare should the wyrm strike? Homes left empty as the people flee to safety...
But forgive me. I am keeping you from your watch. Another time, Arisen.
Short a sparring partner, are you? Else in a mood for japes?
Either way, I must regretfully decline. I am in no mood for play, ser.
Hail, friend. Been some time. Trust you've been well?
But come, if it was idle twittering you'd wanted, you'd have sought a prettier bird than this old crow.
Crows bring tidings, most oft grim. Me, I bring you work. Still grim, I'm afraid. ...Well?
Hear him out
Not now
Salvation again, naturally.
Now there's word they've a man inside the castle.
If that be true, he'll have need to leave the castle eventually, to meet with the others.
All I ask is that you keep watch. If you see someone leaving the castle, shadow them.
I only have need of your eyes. Follow them and see what business has them out. I'll do the rest.
Skulking about is more my line than yours, I know, but pray, lay your chivalry aside this once.
I'd do it myself, but there's aught has me away from Gran Soren for a time. Nothing for it, I fear.
Tell your findings to Arsmith. We have an arrangement...
Tread carefully, friend, and quietly, what's more.
Oh, aye?
Idle twittering it is, then. Shall we speak next of the weather?
Had your fill of birdsong, then?
I've aught to ask your help in, friend.
Hear him out
Not now
Heh, run into trouble, friend? Seems like not everything comes easy to an Arisen, eh?
A simple lack of practice, no doubt. What say you? Fancy another go?
Hear him out
Not now
Playing the shadow is more simple than you might think.
Keep watch over who comes and goes from the castle, and follow them what seem suspicious.
Simple, aye?
Those with aught to hide move about after nightfall. I would know.
You'll learn the rest as you go, friend. Tell anything you learn to Arsmith.

Eyugh.
Eaagh!
Aaaaah...
Ha.
Taah!
How d'you fare, then?
See you again!
Mm-hmm.
Oh, no.
Thank you!
Oh, lovely! Thank you!
You're an Arisen, then, ser?
Then you fight alongside the pawns then, eh? They must need all manner of training!
I well like weapons then, I do.
They've... How to put it. They've a clear purpose, eh?
Smite the foe! There's no deep trick to it, eh? An honesty to that, there is.
Come to think on it, you've got a bit of that feel to you, too, eh?
Say, you're an Arisen then, eh? Seen the dragon up close then, have you?
What do you say, then? Will an ordinary weapon's bite pierce the hide of a beast such as that?
What's that big hole then, eh? Talk is, you're wrapped up in it somehow...
Oh, lovely! Thank you!
Well met, ser. I take you for the Arisen.
Ser Maximilian informed us of your coming. By your leave, I would ask you spearhead our force here.
Our tactics are as such:
We aim to strike from the front gate, but lack the time and means to batter down the doors.
I ask that you pass through the hole you see there and lay open the gate from within.
I cannot say what may await you within. The danger is great, but I trust you will prevail.
Magnificent, ser. The hold is ours once more.
I've sent word of your feats on to the capital. The duke will be most pleased.
As are we all. Pray, accept this token of our thanks and esteem, Arisen.
...Still, their number was too great. No such horde existed in days past.
I fear it an ill omen of things to come. Pray, let it not be too late to stem this tide.
I ask you enter through that hole and lay open the front gate to our charge, Arisen.
I cannot say what may await you within. The danger is great, but I know you will prevail.
Splendid work, Arisen!
Now, we must rout the beasts for good! After me, men!
See there, Arisen? Their chieftain awaits beyond, I'll warrant.
'Tis a chance to win a trophy worthy of your skill, ser. Go, and put them to the blade!
Fall back, men! Retreat!
Turn back! We must reform our line!
We've done it!
Damn... I'll not be seen by my men like this...
Graaaugh!
The beasts are bled and the hold retaken! Victory is ours!

Gone...
Perhaps you've upset them.
There's naught to do here.
Best you moved on.
Not here...
The door is closed.
Shows no sign of opening.
There's aught there...
You don't see anything.
That smell...
Someone's near...
What's this...?
Fine view from here.
There's aught written here...
Must be a way to find something...
Smells delicious.
Perfect spot to place something.
You can almost reach...
There appears to be aught ahead.
That fall could kill.
'Tis dangerous to touch.
A strong blow might break it.
Perhaps if you came by night.
Perhaps if you came by day.
Perhaps if you came at dawn.
Perhaps if you came at dusk.
There's aught buried here...
You see no way up.
'Tis slick, this spot.
No use pressing any further.
No need to double back further.
No time for that now.
You cannot carry any more.
There may yet be aught lying about.
Seems there's naught you can take on at present.<cf>Best to try again later.
Perhaps with a bit of help...
Best you kept your weapon sheathed.
Is someone here...?
'Tis a place for tall folk.
'Tis a place for small folk.
Had you a woman in your band...
Had you a man in your band...
Had you a strong companion...
Had you a swift companion...
Had you a magick user...
Had you an apt climber...
Had you a skilled jumper...
This weapon will not help you.
That armor won't protect you.
You're ill equipped for this.
Seems it can't be used now.
You'll get no further use from it.
'Tis useless, now.
Hmm, not with your current equipment...
Not with your current party...
You hear aught from further in.
Enemies... They're close.
Best you got some rest.
You can carry no more!
You're too exhausted!
"Danger! Keep Out!"
"No Trespassing"
A sign.
Had you an Empty Flask, you might fill it here.
You'll get no further without a lantern.
'Tis dangerous to fumble about in the dark. Best find a light.
Best not just leave them.
If aught were left here, it would rot.
Best take care you don't get lost.
Best check the map.
You're due for a rest.
This place is dangerous by night.
This place is dangerous by day.
Breathtaking...
You'll get no further!
Seems you'll need to come back.
Nothing left here.
It looks fit to crumble.
Seems it could be moved...
It will not budge.
It will not open.
Seems you need a key.
Seems you need a Pickaxe here.
You yet lack the experience.
You yet lack the skill.
Not with your current vocation...
You'll not pass through this gate.
You've no time!
Seems you were too late.
You may make it, yet.
You're doing well for time.
Seems you've come at the wrong time.
There may be another path.
'Tis a powerful weapon... Too bad it doesn't work.
Be wary near any body of water. Wade too<cf>deep and you might be enveloped by the<cf>fog-like monster known as the Brine.
Wander too deep or idle too long in the<cf>water and you'll fall unconscious, washing<cf>ashore later at some faraway place. 
A Ferrystone will spirit you back to Gran<cf>Soren in an instant, no matter where you<cf>are located.
It is by far the fastest and safest method<cf>of travel, but each stone disappears after<cf>a single use.
You can equip yourself with a primary and<cf>a secondary weapon.
Primary weapons such as swords and daggers<cf>are combat essentials. Secondary weapons<cf>like bows and shields offer support.
In addition to weapons and armor, you can<cf>also equip accoutrements with certain special<cf>abilities to give you an edge in battle.
Only one piece of jewelry and a single<cf>cloak can be equipped as accoutrements<cf>at any one time.
A heavy load will cause your Stamina to<cf>deplete more quickly. Sell or discard<cf>any and all items you no longer need.
Your lantern consumes oil. If it dims,<cf>use a Flask of Oil to refill it.
Some items can be combined with others to<cf>produce surprising results. Experiment and<cf>see what you come up with. 
Place waypoint markers on your map to<cf>keep track of your progress.
If you've forgotten where you are in the story,<cf>select "Chronicle" from the Pause Menu to<cf>review a history of your journey thus far.
Select "Options" from the Pause Menu to<cf>customize your mini-map and status display.
The higher the fall, the more damage you<cf>will suffer.
Note that you move somewhat slower while<cf>your weapon is drawn.
Exhausting all Stamina will make you unable<cf>to act for a time. Take care to conserve<cf>energy!
You can attack while clinging to foes.
Petrifaction cannot be cured by normal<cf>magick, and is fatal if left untreated.
Use Secret Softener or the like to<cf>cure any petrified allies.
Your rank within a vocation rises as you<cf>defeat foes and complete quests. At higher<cf>ranks, a broader variety of skills are available.
Defeating foes and completing quests earns<cf>you more discipline, boosting your prowess<cf>in a vocation.
Pawns will collect and use items of their<cf>own volition.
You cannot carry or purchase items that<cf>would cause you to exceed your maximum<cf>encumbrance.
Press <TUTO><SIZE 25><ICON TOUCH></SIZE> while climbing down a ladder<cf>to descend quickly. 
If a pawn remains unconscious for too long,<cf>they will be forfeit.
Your support pawn has become forfeit, and<cf>returned to the realm whence they came.
Your main pawn has become forfeit,<cf>disappearing and returning to the rift.
You cannot join covenants with other pawns<cf>while your main pawn is forfeit.
Touch any riftstone to return your lost<cf>main pawn to your side.
If a support pawn is forfeit, any items<cf>they were carrying are sent to item storage.
You can send off departing pawns with a<cf>single item as a gift for their creator.
You can pass items to and from your pawns<cf>on the sub menu.
A visitor! This is... Well, we so rarely receive travelers here, and so... Yes, please. Be welcome.
The stories say Arisen are instilled with the power to defeat dragons.
I shall pray you find your strength, Arisen. We...we shall all of us pray for you.
Duke Edmun, the one they name Dragonsbane, once took up the mantle of Arisen himself. 
The duke had the Maker's blessing upon him... I know for true you share it as well.
The Faith has spent long years gathering knowledge about the dragon.
The Grand Cathedral is home to our scholars -- they who spend their lives researching the riddle of the dragon.
I...I have faith they will guide us in our battle against evil. 
You have done it! You have silenced the evil that threatened our land. I had faith you could do such...
Saved... We're saved! It's almost... Well, it's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest.
When I look up to give thanks and see this black and chilling sky, it makes me...it makes me scared all over again.
'Tis like too late to do anything now.
You must hold it! Just a while longer!
Oof
[PUNCHED IN THE GUT REAX - "Oough"]
Guahhh...
[THROWING PUNCH EXERTS]
[SWINGING HEAVY STAFF EXERTS]
Yes?
We'll meet again.
[AFFIRMATIVE NOISE - "mm"]
No.
...That's acceptable.
You're more interesting than I'd thought.
You know what curiosity earned the cat, hm?
Rethinking your challenge?
Suffer!
Word on the wind is there's a healer in Cassardis<cf>who crafts cures from Sunbright and Herbs. I've<cf>a need for the medicine, but I'm not fain to risk<cf>the roads. I seek someone to make the trip in<cf>my stead and fetch back a sample.
The men of the waycastle are famously hale and<cf>hearty. Fighting the beasts of the crags must<cf>foster an iron constitution. What's more, there's<cf>talk of a poultice made from a special lichen<cf>that grows nearby. The name escapes me, but<cf>I'd be greatly obliged to have some.
'Tis said there exists a medicament from the<cf>lands east of the sea that gives a man the<cf>strength of an aurochs. I could well use a bit of<cf>that to see me through my labors here.
I'm newly come to the capital, and the pace at<cf>which the city moves has me near breathless. I<cf>dearly miss the invigorating Mushrooms pickled<cf>in Greenwarish my mother oft made.
Emissary to Meloire seeks potent tonic to gift<cf>to Andrian, seventh son of the ruling House<cf>Becker, on the occasion of the completion of<cf>his palace.
My husband's long served the duke as a<cf>man-at-arms without complaint, but 'tis plain to<cf>see that following the orders of greenhorn<cf>lordlings and attending long sessions of the war<cf>council are taking their toll. I wish to gift him a<cf>tonic to raise his spirits!
I once heard of a southron man what could eat<cf>poison with no ill effect. Seems the mad fool's<cf>spent years sipping a brew laced with the stuff<cf>to accustom his body to it. Says the Maker's<cf>hand preserved him. I've a mind to try it here,<cf>maybe earn the Maker's protection myself.
'Tis harder work than you'd think to draw a bow<cf>and keep it steady long enough to feather a<cf>target. If there's a restorative out there to<cf>lend a fellow Stamina, I'd be glad of it.
A swordmaster from the mainland once told me<cf>'tis a blind man what tracks his foes with his<cf>eyes -- the true warrior sees with his heart.<cf>I confess, I haven't the slightest idea what he<cf>meant. I aim to learn, though, so I've need of<cf>some Drowsy-Eel Stew.
Dark rumors from the mainland tell of ordinary<cf>folk, afeared of the dragon's coming, turning to<cf>a strange substance. Seems all who took it<cf>stopped speaking, then disappeared altogether.<cf>I would spare Gransys of such a fate. Find me<cf>the drug, and I'll craft an antidote.
My son is ever plagued by cuts and bruises. In<cf>days past, I administered a compound bought<cf>from a traveling peddler, but with the dragon<cf>come, such merchants are few. 'Twas a mix of<cf>a poison and its antitoxin, as I recall. I should be<cf>grateful to have more.
Enlistment Corps supplymaster requests<cf>curatives to sustain the war effort at the<cf>Greatwall.
These new men haven't a spine among them!<cf>Even just the march to the Bluemoon Tower<cf>yields no end of complaints, and I haven't the<cf>time to offer each man a damned tonic.<cf>Someone bring me restoratives that will treat<cf>the lot of them at once!<cf>             —Ser Berne, Master of Arms
Emissary to Meloire seeks potent restorative to<cf>gift to Hubrant, eleventh son of the ruling<cf>House Becker on the occasion of the<cf>completion of his palace.
In my grandfather's day, there was a<cf>potionmaker in the woods -- a witch, to put it<cf>plain. Bring her herbs, and she'd make an ale<cf>like no other. Talk is, a descendent of hers is still<cf>there, deep in the wood. I'd dearly love another<cf>taste of that ale.
A few moons back I was carousing with the<cf>southron bandits and we drank an herb ale fine<cf>and sweet as a maid's kiss. Strong, though.<cf>Knocked the lot of us on our arses. They said it<cf>was a magick brew, fetched from the heart of<cf>the Witchwood. I'd kill for another quaff.
Ser Mercedes has a refined look to her, but she<cf>can drink any man in the Corps under the table --<cf>she swills spirits like mother's milk. Myself, I<cf>can only stomach liquor cut with the extract of<cf>herbs. Tasty enough, then, though. Which is<cf>why I'd like some, if you would.
Seems there's a special sort of ale crafted just<cf>for the duke by a witch, from the rarest of<cf>herbs. Us common folk do work that's a damn<cf>sight harder than sitting a throne all day. We<cf>deserve a taste of the good stuff, too!
Duke's provisioner seeks additional spirits for a<cf>banquet to receive state guests from the<cf>mainland.
The House Frescobaldi kitchen staff requires an<cf>exceptional beverage for Mistress Symone's<cf>nameday feast.
The duke's chamberlain seeks a suitable gift to<cf>send with his emissary to Hearthstone.
My son swallowed some wild berries and has taken<cf>ill. The poison is not fatal, but still I wish to<cf>ease his suffering. An antidote of nuts crushed<cf>with a stone of the like found near the waycastle<cf>is said to work well.
My charge, Mistress Symone, is afflicted with<cf>an insufficiency of physical exercise I have<cf>hitherto treated with a medicament of oil<cf>crafted in the south. As the roads grow ever<cf>more dangerous, supply, too, grows scarce.<cf>I humbly ask for assistance in acquiring more.
Six years ago, war swept through my village. I<cf>was left with a deep scar across my face, and<cf>my lover blinded. I confess I felt a selfish relief<cf>at the time. But now I hear talk of a cure for<cf>blindness. He may recoil to look upon me, but<cf>even so, I would give him back his sight.
My young son refuses to leave his bedroom for<cf>fear of the dragon. I fondly recall the days he<cf>spent racing along Cassardis's shore collecting<cf>stones. Surely there must be some way to<cf>return to those days?
My bride has not stirred in a weeks' time. She<cf>was ever a sound sleeper, but this seems an<cf>excess by any standard. Please, I grow<cf>desperate for aught that might rouse her.
A dark sorcerer controlling an army of pawns<cf>has arisen in southern Auldring. The duke has<cf>been asked to furnish supplies for the force<cf>being dispatched.
Pray, hear me: No one will acknowledge my<cf>talents! Are they blinded with fear of the wyrm?<cf>Aye, perhaps! But more importantly, I feel the<cf>weight of their disdain strangling my talent<cf>while it yet sleeps. Fetch me a drug to awaken<cf>it!
My village was attacked by monsters, and so we<cf>fled. Now they say the dragon is coming here. It<cf>must be my fault. I must be cursed! I don't wish<cf>any others to get hurt. Please find a cure that<cf>will break this hex!
A marauding brood of cockatrices has left an<cf>entire village in Hearthstone petrified. His<cf>Grace Duke Edmun has been asked to help<cf>furnish remedies.
I've served with the castle guard longer than<cf>most men have been alive, but I fear age has<cf>finally dulled my blade. I aim to redouble my<cf>training, but my body is not fain to cooperate. I<cf>seek a medicament to put the strength of youth<cf>back in these bones.
I've cause to take my family past the waycastle<cf>and on to Cassardis, but our cart ox won't<cf>budge. The beast was struck fearful by an<cf>attacking griffin just days ago. If there exists a<cf>tonic to bolster a fellow's mettle, mayhap it<cf>would encourage the beast just the same.
I'm he that sought to regain the vigor of his<cf>youth, and my training is well under way for<cf>having found it. Now I aim to try an even more<cf>rigorous course, and ask for a tonic to further<cf>strengthen my sinews. I'll not have it said I<cf>rely on such drugs, but they do bolster a man's<cf>nerve.
'Twas by way of the quarry I came to this city,<cf>and Maker's breath, it was hell. It seems the<cf>monsters there favor the fairer sex, either as an<cf>easier target or for...other designs. Just the<cf>thought of it! I must be well protected if I'm to<cf>defend my honor.
Salomet's spellcraft is the stuff of legend. He<cf>once burnt an army of 100 to ash in the blink of<cf>an eye, 'tis said on the mainland. I'd love to<cf>feel that sort of power coursing through me, if<cf>only for a fleeting moment.
'Tis said the sunken ruins behind the falls once<cf>served as a dueling ground for wizards. I<cf>suppose forgotten places of that ilk have a way<cf>of calling to those with ties to the magickal arts.<cf>If you happen across any provisions left behind,<cf>I would have them for my own.
I've no one to rely upon but myself. I must<cf>endure, come what may. I will! Pray, find me a<cf>tonic to grant me power enough to stand on my<cf>own!
I fear my son is uncommon prone to ailment.<cf>The poor child has spent half his youth indoors<cf>for fear of illness, and I can bear to watch it no<cf>longer. If aught exists to ward against infirmity<cf>while he might run free and explore nature, I<cf>would pay dearly for it.
I've no luck of late. I lost my post. My wife is<cf>returned home to the south with our daughter<cf>in tow. I was even beset by goblins! The beasts<cf>near killed me. Would someone take pity on a<cf>luckless man and find something that might<cf>bring weal?
I paid a peddler half a fortune for a ward<cf>against monsters, which was all well and good<cf>until I lost the thing! Have you seen the road<cf>from Gran Soren to Cassardis? Bristling with<cf>saurians, and I've a violent aversion to them!<cf>Pray, find me that ward.
I was a fool to have braved Soulflayer Canyon,<cf>shortcut or no. I dropped precious charms my<cf>friend gifted me, but you'll not see me returning<cf>to find them. Not with those beasts prowling<cf>about. Might someone go and retrieve them for me?
True, the charm that peddler in the quarry sold<cf>brought me coin. It also brought monsters,<cf>thieves, and a dreadful sluggishness of body,<cf>besides! Next I see that blighted merchant, I've<cf>a mind to stuff a few of the damned things down<cf>his gullet! Or hide them among his wares, at the<cf>least...
An army is judged on the scale of raw power. 'Tis<cf>long been said the best defense is a good<cf>offense! Kill them first and you needn't worry,<cf>eh? If the young fools in my command won't heed<cf>reason, I'll just beat this womanly mewling out<cf>of them!
"A man is at his strongest when he has aught to<cf>protect." Those were my father's words, and I<cf>understand them fully only now my sweet wife has<cf>borne me a daughter. I would withstand any<cf>hardship to keep them safe. I will be their<cf>shield.
I served in the duke's academy of magickal<cf>inquiry in the days before its fall, researching<cf>not only spellcraft, but the human psyche as<cf>well. Even now, I continue my studies in private,<cf>concocting compounds and noting their effects<cf>upon magick and the mind. Truly, 'tis a boundless<cf>field.
For love of country, I set out from Cassardis<cf>some five long years ago and have trained<cf>tirelessly in spellcraft ever since. I fear I am<cf>fast reaching my limits of endurance in<cf>weathering spells, though. Pray, someone grant me<cf>the strength to bear the unbearable!
'Tis rumored the stones atop Hillfigure Knoll<cf>were living men, once. The writings of a traveler<cf>detail the matter, and claim the power to bestow<cf>the stone-sleep lies there still, atop the selfsame<cf>hill. 'Tis like an empty rumor, but only a fool<cf>would pass the chance at such power by.
Long ago, 'tis said a mage undertook the study of<cf>the wyrm in hopes of destroying it, but his wife<cf>mistook his intention. In the end, he was put to<cf>the flame for heresy. As he burned, he cursed<cf>her. Cursed all the world. Now a relic of his<cf>sleeps in the catacombs, though I fear to seek<cf>it.
Somewhere in my drunken revels I seem to have<cf>misplaced my purse. I recall splashing about at<cf>our riverside festivus, but the rest is a fog.<cf>Should some kind fellow happen upon it, I beg<cf>they would see it back to me.
I've forgotten my pickaxe, Maker help me. 'Twas<cf>my father's before me, and irreplaceable. I'll<cf>wager it yet remains at the waycastle cottage,<cf>but that place is become a den for thieves, and<cf>I'm not fain to approach it. After all, my head's<cf>irreplaceable, too.
A legendary flower said to blossom but once in a<cf>century has been seen in the south. For a<cf>collector of such botanical rarities, 'tis a<cf>chance I cannot  hope to encounter again. The<cf>specimen is said to bloom in strong sunlight. I<cf>will see the one who finds it is well rewarded.
My present research deals in a foreign ritual of<cf>a rather singular nature, and I fear 'tis a<cf>struggle to gather sufficient skulls without<cf>resorting to indelicate methods. I hear they<cf>litter the west, however, where the cyclopes<cf>roam. I ask for help in procuring them.
The Auldale, at Gransys's north extreme, is said<cf>to be the remnants of a city razed by dragonfire.<cf>Its dangers have long kept out scholars and<cf>thieves alike, and so the rumors of hidden<cf>treasure continue unabated. Will any brave soul<cf>go and prove them false or true?
'Tis said that skeleton mages are the undead<cf>remnants of men possessed by phantoms. Well,<cf>says I, if they were mages in life, they like held<cf>grimoires. Who can say what power sleeps in<cf>such a tome?
When I was a boy, another wall stood round the<cf>capital, beyond the one that stands now. 'Twas<cf>a colony of griffins tore it down, some thirty<cf>years ago. Fearsome beasts, those. We spent<cf>weeks playing amid the wreckage... I'd love a<cf>token of the memory.
Pray, speak of this to no one, but I now study<cf>the alchemickal synthesis of pawns! In theory,<cf>'tis possible to craft a man from a single hair,<cf>whole save for his soul. 'Tis a crime that only<cf>the Arisen should command pawns. I shall<cf>create my own!
This new perfume come from the mainland is<cf>said to serve as a ward against the dragon. A<cf>groundless claim -- naught but tinted water, I'd<cf>wager, though I've not a vialful to prove it. I<cf>suspect the southron bandits have a hand in this<cf>scheme.
Time was a beast tamer called that forest in<cf>west Gransys home. Obsessed with magicking<cf>creatures into existence, he was, but his dark<cf>experiments fouled the place -- why they call it<cf>the Wilted Forest now. Some say bits of his<cf>craft yet remain there. I ask they be found for<cf>the sake of future research.
A man of the Faith -- or so he claimed -- offered<cf>me a tidy sum to recover a certain letter, but<cf>the task is proving more difficult than I could<cf>have imagined. Now this "pious brother" is<cf>making grave threats against me and mine! If<cf>any might help me retrieve the missive, I would<cf>gladly share the reward.
The horns the capital guards sound are lovely,<cf>and their call as clear and pure as a spring<cf>morn. I would have one of my own.
The blighted roof's taken to leaking like a<cf>broken sieve. Even clear days, now, we're beset<cf>with the dripping remnants of the last rain,<cf>soaked into the thatching. One bucket is<cf>woefully unable to keep up. Pray, someone<cf>fetch me another!
Damn the dragon's scales for the madness it's<cf>unleashed! The other day a monster invaded my<cf>fields. I ran out shouting and waving my hoe<cf>about until the damned thing flew off. The hoe,<cf>that is. Lost my grip, and away it went. Can't<cf>very well farm without one, now can I.
I was having a row with the wife when the<cf>crazed wench tossed my hammer out the<cf>window. I can't do a lick of work without it. If<cf>anyone sees the damned thing, bring it to me,<cf>would you?
I half emptied my coffers for that scroll, and<cf>it's been stolen! 'Twas the only of its kind, a<cf>catalogue of techniques for combating large<cf>monsters. All my fortunes were riding upon it,<cf>and it's gone! Please, help me to retrieve it!
You'd think the dragon's brought a plague of<cf>dust with it, to look at our home. My husband's<cf>given over to terrible fits of coughing. I'd<cf>thought to clean house and quiet the racket, but<cf>it seems I've mislaid my broom. Does anyone<cf>have a spare?
Maker forgive me, I've lost my scriptures again.<cf>I am a sad failure of a priest.
We were playing swords and serpents with<cf>mother's platter for a shield when we lost it.<cf>Mother will be so cross. Please find it afore she<cf>notices.
Meat, like fruit and fine wine, must ripen afore<cf>it peaks in flavor. 'Tis best just afore it rots.<cf>Only a barbarian would lunge upon it fresh from<cf>the slaughter. True culinarians wait till the<cf>meat is set to spoil, then preserve it within an<cf>Airtight Flask.
I've need of fish. The larger and fresher the<cf>better. Don't neglect to preserve them in<cf>Airtight Flasks for freshness.
My latest experiments in the culinary arts<cf>require an egg, just poised to spoil, preserved<cf>within a sealed flask.
My grandfather has a great love for fruit. Dried<cf>grapes, most of all. This dark business of the<cf>dragon's coming has cast a gloom o'er him of<cf>late, and I would dearly like to cheer him with a<cf>gift of those grapes, in an Airtight Flask to<cf>keep them.
The gentle sea breeze that laps at Cassardis<cf>comes at the cost of arid soil, unfit for most<cf>crops. 'Tis the lot of a fishing village to go<cf>without fresh vegetables, but we long for them<cf>just the same. In an Airtight Flask, if you<cf>please.
A warrior should have keen sight to strike even<cf>the smallest targets with precision. Lately the<cf>seabirds have been all over the fish we dry out<cf>in the village. Hunt some of them down and help<cf>hone your warrior's eye.
The wolves of the Witchwood are bloodthirsty<cf>creatures, and we've had no end of attacks<cf>upon travelers along the road there. I fear 'tis<cf>our survival or theirs. You must hunt the beasts<cf>down.
A plague of phantasms haunt the lands to<cf>the west. Dispel them afore they can work<cf>any evil on the good folk of Gransys.
A band of cyclopes lurk in the depths of the<cf>Watergod's Altar. Countless scholars who would<cf>investigate the ruins have met with injury at<cf>their giant hands. We can suffer these brutes<cf>no longer -- they must be destroyed.
Soulflayer Canyon, some leagues north of here,<cf>is home to a great many snow harpies. And little<cf>wonder -- the lay of the land works greatly in<cf>their favor. 'Tis a fair distance to travel, <cf>but you'll find no better place to train against<cf>creatures of the air.
Brawn alone will not avail you against the likes<cf>of a phantom. Best you consider the vocation<cf>and skills of each member of your party afore<cf>engaging their kind.
The catacombs are hearth and home to the<cf>forces of the undead. Though they might be<cf>returned to death quick enough, their great<cf>numbers can overwhelm even a seasoned<cf>hand. They must not be allowed up to the<cf>surface.
Though the griffin is king among the beasts of<cf>the Bluemoon Tower, the skeleton knights that<cf>haunt the road before it are no less a threat.<cf>Their intelligence makes them difficult to pin<cf>down, though they still cannot outwit a living<cf>human. Prove it as you put them to the blade.
Monsters prowl in ever-widening circles these<cf>days, I fear. The north is now half overrun with<cf>direwolves, outstripping their standard  cousins<cf>in size and cruelty both. Still, they fall before<cf>a blade just the same. Go and see to them.
The abandoned well in Cassardis is half full of<cf>slain saurians, yet still the lizards breed<cf>there. But take hope in this: their leader is<cf>come -- a sulfur saurian. Slay it, and we'll like<cf>have no further trouble from their kind.
Though dimwitted, the ogres near the abbey<cf>have a grotesque appetite for women. Just the<cf>other day, a group of the sisters very nearly<cf>became a supper for the beasts. They escaped<cf>by the Maker's mercy, but this problem really<cf>must be remedied.
No man is immune from the wiles of the succubi<cf>of Soulflayer Canyon. If you would hunt their ilk,<cf>pay careful consideration to what manner of<cf>party accompanies you.
'Tis a handful of skeleton mages what control<cf>the walking bones of the Watergod's Altar. Slay<cf>the mages, and the rest will fall into disorder.<cf>We'll have no better chance to neuter this<cf>threat. Go, and see them destroyed!
'Tis said the liches of the catacombs are the<cf>tainted souls of men -- great wizards who died<cf>with hearts full of bitter rage. They've<cf>o'erstayed their welcome in this world. Quiet<cf>their anger with your merciful blade.
Grimgoblins have been sighted not far from<cf>Cassardis. Mistake them not for their weaker<cf>brethren, for they are stronger and more deadly<cf>by far. If suffered to roam free, they'll make<cf>the roads unfit to walk even in broad daylight.<cf>Rid your homeland of these fiends.
Never before have I heard talk of hellhounds in<cf>the Witchwood, yet they are come just the<cf>same. 'Tis the dragon's return that has spread<cf>this taint. They must be dispatched. Take<cf>utmost care, ser.
The saurians grow ever wilder in the noisome<cf>swamplands known as the Fetor, west of the<cf>capital. We cannot allow them to continue<cf>unchecked. Talk of phantasms in the region<cf>means you'd best armor yourself against<cf>thundershock ere setting out.
The Frontier Caverns beyond the Shadow Fort<cf>have become a breeding ground for goblins.<cf>'Tis come time to end this problem at its source.<cf>Find their camp and bleed enough of the beasts<cf>to make them think twice of crossing a human<cf>ever again.
The harpies of the north are of a different<cf>stripe than their southron sisters. Their voices<cf>are no less deadly, but what's more they<cf>breathe ice. Bring an archer to give them a few<cf>new feathers.
Go and slay a knot of spiders. If you think this<cf>an easy task, I bid you think again! Though it<cf>will serve you well in training patience and<cf>vigilance.
Phantoms roam the region around the<cf>catacombs by night, taking possession of man<cf>and pawn alike. But do not let this haunting<cf>shake you. 'Tis when they've taken hold of a<cf>host that their defenses are lowest. That is<cf>when you strike!
You've grown, ser. At last you bear the mien of<cf>a tempered warrior, well-versed in the art of<cf>combat. Very well. 'Tis time your training was<cf>complete. I shall impart this final lesson to you<cf>myself. Hold nothing back, for I shall spare you<cf>no mercy!

I am soon to be posted to an unfamiliar land,<cf>and mislike the thought of defending a place I<cf>know naught of. I seek a capable companion to<cf>join me in scouting the region.
I would offer a prayer at the resting place of my<cf>fallen brother-in-arms afore I leave on the great<cf>march. An escort would be most welcome.
The oracle warned that I would surely die in the<cf>battle to come if I did not first travel to the<cf>site to dispel the ill fortune that there awaits.<cf>I seek a partner for the journey.
I've been charged with the task of gathering<cf>materials, but do not fancy the thought of<cf>traipsing through lands o'errun with monsters.<cf>I should feel far better with a strong escort<cf>along.
The banquet's planned and the guests invited.<cf>Now all that remains is to fetch the ingredients.<cf>I know where they grow, but I'm like to become<cf>a meal myself if I go to harvest them<cf>unaccompanied.
By order of the Faith, I travel the land<cf>investigating the dragon. I believe I've located<cf>new evidence of academic merit, but require<cf>protection in order to reach it. I pray the Maker<cf>send me a stalwart aide in this matter.
I dearly wish to make a pilgrimage to the site<cf>where the great sage Orinth is said to have<cf>purified the land long ago. All who travel to<cf>this hidden sanctuary are blessed with the<cf>Maker's divine protection. I fear to make the<cf>trip alone, though. Will no one see me safely<cf>there?
A rare scroll from the mainland speaks of a<cf>mystical stone somewhere in our own Gransys<cf>which, with a single touch, can spare a person<cf>of all evils, be it dragonfire, disease, or<cf>destitution. I ask for an escort to find this<cf>fabled rock.
A nice peddler told me of a spot with a view<cf>more grand than any other. I do dearly wish to<cf>see it! Will someone strong and able please see<cf>me there?
This traveling peddler asks the company of a<cf>seasoned escort on the roads.
I've unearthed a map of dubious origins, and it<cf>has me quite perplexed. I cannot help but<cf>believe it lays out the path to aught of value.<cf>Treasure, perhaps. But everyone I've spoken to<cf>laughs it off as folly. I assure you, I am most<cf>serious! Pray, someone escort me to the place it<cf>details!
If I hope to one day make a name for myself in<cf>the duke's army, I shall need valor enough to<cf>brave untold dangers alone. I aim to ease into<cf>such feats by first traveling with an escort.
My world has lost its color and I've no desire to<cf>go on. All I wish is to see that place just once<cf>more ere I go. Pray, someone deliver me there.
I know of a place some leagues removed from<cf>the other mines that houses sands and ore of a<cf>higher caliber, but my pickaxe is ill defense<cf>against monsters. I ask only for protection long<cf>enough to see me to the site.
A peddler keen to keep his skin gifted me with a<cf>treasure map not long ago, and I aim to test its<cf>veracity. 'Tis a fine opportunity to put the new<cf>boys through their paces, what's more. See<cf>them to the map's end, and if any lags or runs<cf>off, see they don't come back.
We've been instructed to ready ourselves for<cf>deployment on a moment's notice by taking<cf>practice marches in our leisure time. I could<cf>well do with the combat practice, but it would<cf>ill serve to get injured. I ask for someone to<cf>accompany me in the field.
I see no sense in erecting walls and holds to<cf>stay a dragon, and even less sense wasting<cf>one's life manning the blighted things. Comes a<cf>time a fellow wants to leave his post and gripe a<cf>while. That's all.
Unless we take up net and rod soon, we'll be<cf>eating sand afore the season's end. But the<cf>shore here remains bedeviled by monsters...<cf>I aim to seek out new fishing waters, but want<cf>for protection to reach them.

Pawn Wanted<cf>Done work with this one before, I have. Good<cf>stamina and swift, besides. I've another task<cf>he'd be well-suited to. Pray, fetch him here.
Pawn Wanted<cf>What became of that one after his stint at the<cf>alehouse? He made terrible conversation, but<cf>his work was impeccable. The customers liked<cf>him well. Suppose you could bring him back?
Pawn Wanted<cf>I'll never train these new recruits alone. I fought<cf>alongside a pawn not long ago who would make<cf>a fine instructor. If he's about, I'd like you to<cf>find him.
Pawn Wanted<cf>'Tis most urgent I locate the aforementioned<cf>pawn. I thank you for your assistance.
Pawn Wanted<cf>I am to accompany a group of other women<cf>across the mountains to the mainland, and need<cf>to provide for our protection. I ask that a<cf>pawn of this description be procured.
Pawn Wanted<cf>I am newly posted to the west, and my travels<cf>will see me through the territory of a band of<cf>woman thieves. 'Tis my hope to escape their ire<cf>with the aid of a pawn.
Pawn Wanted<cf>I seek a pawn refined in manner and well-versed<cf>in foreign tongues to help in receiving guests<cf>from the mainland. I met one some months<cf>back who, while a hair gaunt,  bore a suitable<cf>mien.
Pawn Wanted<cf>I seek a cutthroat posthaste, steady of hand<cf>and fleet of foot.
Pawn Wanted<cf>I met a most curious pawn in the alehouse some<cf>days prior. Though his language was polite, he<cf>spun tales of his exploits peppered with a<cf>humor most wicked. 'Twas quite enthralling,<cf>really. I should love to hear more.
Pawn Wanted<cf>Quite famous in those parts, he was.<cf>Thunderflash, they called him. A Ranger to put<cf>all others to shame, though I suspect he'll have<cf>laid down his bow by now. Still, I'd dearly love<cf>to meet him!
Pawn Wanted<cf>My grandmother traveled with a pawn in her<cf>youth -- a sorceress of uncommon beauty.<cf>Then, just the other day, Nana sees a girl looked<cf>just like her walking the roads. She'd dearly<cf>love to know if it's the same girl, for certain.
Pawn Wanted<cf>I fear our maid has gotten herself terribly lost.<cf>The house is a hopeless mess without her to<cf>tend to it. Might I ask that someone return her<cf>to us?
Pawn Wanted<cf>Pawns make for far better sparring partners<cf>than straw men do, and I'll need all the practice<cf>I can manage if I'm to face the wyrm. Pray, help<cf>me find a worthy opponent.
Pawn Wanted<cf>I met a pawn outside Cassardis who had helped<cf>me once. Curiously enough, they mentioned<cf>you, ser. Said that they'd accompanied you to<cf>the encampment and told you of the legion.<cf>I should like to speak with that pawn again.
Pawn Wanted<cf>I was an orphan child, spared from solitude by a<cf>kindly pawn. He was ever surrounded by a<cf>warm, curious scent of oil. 'Tis the smell of<cf>family, to me. He disappeared some years ago.<cf>I dearly miss him.
Pawn Wanted<cf>I cannot sleep for this terrible longing. Knowing<cf>that my sweet is near, even now. 'Tis too much<cf>to hold inside any longer! I must confess the<cf>contents of my love-mad heart!
Pawn Wanted<cf>A monster set upon me not two days past.<cf>I might well have died, had this pawn not<cf>interceded. He was gone afore fear released my<cf>tongue, and I would like to thank him properly.
Pawn Wanted<cf>I'm an apprentice fisherman, but despite my<cf>efforts I've still no feel for the trade. I met a<cf>pawn some months back who seemed at one<cf>with the sea itself. I'd dearly love to beg a<cf>lesson from such a master.
Pawn Wanted<cf>I've come to learn that most pawns are affable<cf>enough if you bother to speak with them,<cf>which is why it galls me to see Salvation use<cf>them so. You bring me a pawn clothed in the<cf>cult's garb and I'll set them straight.
Pawn Wanted<cf>They say every man, woman, and child in the<cf>world shares a face with three pawns. Do you<cf>fancy there's a pawn out there with this humble<cf>innkeep's mien? 'Twould be a laugh to see, that.

Deep beneath the Shadow Fort 'tis said to lurk a<cf>cyclops mantled in the armor of a thousand<cf>warriors, each fallen at the monster's hands.<cf>Should any brave soul manage to slay the beast,<cf>I shall gift them with a treasure of my own.
I await you in the Frontier Caverns.
Tis said a mighty cockatrice makes its kip in the<cf>depths of Soulflayer Canyon. Should it arise and<cf>descend upon the capital, the damage would be<cf>immeasurable. We must see that it never awakens.
Reports of peddlers and pawns attacked by<cf>cyclopes have become a daily matter. The duke<cf>has dispatched a force from Gran Soren, but the<cf>brutes are vast in number. There have been<cf>sightings near the falls, and in the south. Go<cf>and thin their ranks.
A rivalry twixt the bandits of the west and south<cf>drives them to ever bolder crimes as one<cf>competes against the other. Do they not see<cf>that now is the hour to band together against<cf>the wyrm? Pray, clear the southern roads of<cf>these fool thieves.
'Tis a fool dismisses goblins as a harmless<cf>nuisance. What poses no threat to an armed<cf>soldier can still kill a woman or child. They<cf>possess strength in numbers, and show an<cf>unsettling boldness, besides. If we're to<cf>discourage them, we'll need to cut down a<cf>goodly number here.
Some claim goblins were once docile creatures,<cf>though I doubt it to look upon the devils now.<cf>They've grown especially bold in the south of<cf>late. If they'll not listen to reason, cold<cf>steel will suffice. 
Rumors abound that men felled in battle<cf>have risen as undead not long after. I cannot<cf>help but feel pity that these poor souls are<cf>robbed even of death... Please,  deliver them<cf>a peaceful -- and final -- rest.
Gone are the days when goblins were confined<cf>to the Shadow Fort. Now, with the hobgoblins<cf>to lead them, they've marched on all Gransys.<cf>We must not suffer them to grow any bolder!<cf>Slay the hobgoblins and stop this plague from<cf>spreading further.
As beasts of the air, harpies are a threat most<cf>troublesome. What's more, their speed makes a<cf>mockery of ballistas, especially in tight quarters.<cf>You, then, must be swifter still. Strike them<cf>down with bowfire and magick.
Accounts of travelers on the northern roads<cf>being carried off by snow harpies have grown<cf>commonplace. We must provide for the<cf>people's safety. I submit that a hunting party be<cf>dispatched forthwith.
Even those who survive a phantasm's lightning<cf>are said to be plagued evermore by ill will and<cf>disquiet. Perhaps the rage that animates those<cf>fell creatures takes hold of their victims as<cf>well. 'Tis clear the haunting by the Watergod's<cf>Altar must be stopped.
Beware the fluid what saurians spit. They oft<cf>dwell in darkness, where a fellow is blind<cf>without a dry torch. What's more, there's talk of<cf>clutches of saurian eggs in southern Gransys and<cf>near the river north of Gran Soren. We can ill<cf>afford to let them hatch. Destroy them on sight.
An ancient breed of reptile has been seen in the<cf>lands near the Tainted Mountain. They say 'tis<cf>these same geo saurians what left the Auldale in<cf>ruins. Still, I've faith you'll be victorious, ser.
My father was a hunter, as his father and his<cf>father's father before him. And every one of<cf>them, to a man, died encircled by wolves. I'm<cf>trapped in fate's web, ser. I've huntsman's<cf>blood in me, but I'd like to keep it there. Would<cf>that this land was rid of wolves!
Many's the time I wandered near the bandits'<cf>hold as a boy, only to come running home in<cf>tatters, a breath ahead of a pack of direwolves.<cf>They're good memories, in their own way, but I<cf>lie awake anights thinking my own boy may do<cf>the same. Please, put those curs to death.
We cannot allow the walking dead to roam<cf>unchecked. They are the harbingers of death<cf>itself, trumpeters of coming doom. They must<cf>not be suffered to exist among the living.
I took up work slaying revenants for the Abbey,<cf>but I was bested. I know my limits well, and<cf>those stout undead are a force I cannot<cf>overcome. I beg you, go and stop them in my<cf>stead.
Damn every last bone of those blighted<cf>skeletons! Presumptuous rotters, accosting the<cf>living when they haven't even a brain left in<cf>their pates! Damned well ruined all my wares,<cf>they did -- I'll not rest till they've been ground<cf>down to powder!
You'll like have heard the theory liches are the<cf>remnants of grand wizards what died wracked<cf>with bitter rage. 'Tis all the blighted things are,<cf>rage. There's not a speck of good to be had in<cf>suffering such a thing to linger on. Best we<cf>were rid of them!
We sisters of the abbey are beset by deer. The<cf>gentle creatures would ne'er attack a human,<cf>but our crops receive no such deference. If<cf>they eat any more, we shall surely starve. Pray,<cf>encourage them to find a new pasture.
If there is one thing I cannot abide, it's mice!<cf>Even just to think of them makes me ill. The<cf>other day I took the number of rodents in my<cf>home and tabulated their number in all the<cf>realm... I nearly fainted. In any case, I want<cf>them dead! As many as you can manage.
An unspeakable beast has risen in the west. Go<cf>and cut it down with all haste, afore it descends<cf>upon the capital!
A griffin has been spotted near Hillfigure Knoll.<cf>To allow it to roam free now is to sow seeds of<cf>misfortune for the times to come.
I was beset by monsters from the sky while on a<cf>courier's errand. The feathered fiends flew off<cf>with all my deliveries, to the eyries of the west,<cf>no doubt -- Soulflayer Canyon. Pray, retrieve my<cf>lost packages!
Call it a drunk's ramblings, but my mate claims<cf>that the infamous brigand Maul grants a token<cf>of his trust to folk outside his merry band what<cf>earn it. Wasn't yet deep in his cups when he<cf>said it, neither. I bet an item of that ilk fetches<cf>quite a price. I'll trade my finest treasure for it.
Ophis, the leader of those lady bandits, makes<cf>no bones about her hate for men, though I hear<cf>she's made bones of many a man. Still, it's like a<cf>siren's song to me... I dare only steal glances<cf>from afar now, but if you brought me a token of<cf>her friendship... Please! I'll make it well worth<cf>your while!
I study to become a merchant, running goods<cf>'tween Gransys and Hearthstone, but this<cf>bookkeeping business will be my undoing. I've<cf>no clue what to keep tally of, much less how.<cf>Isn't there some example I might follow?<cf>A register, or some record of investment or<cf>somesuch?
People of Gransys, I throw myself upon your<cf>tender mercies. The duke's chamberlain<cf>entrusted to me a letter of thanks for Master<cf>Frescobaldi, for his unstinting financial support.<cf>A letter which, to my eternal mortification, I<cf>have lost. Pray, help me recover the document,<cf>and with it a shred of my dignity.
I've orders to keep watch on a certain wealthy<cf>individual and the tribute he pays the duke. In<cf>truth, there's evidence that a portion of the<cf>gift is being diverted and usurped for personal<cf>gain. Had I some record of the tribute, it would<cf>serve in a formal inquest. I welcome any<cf>information.
 
The duke's chamberlain requires a reliable<cf>escort to accompany His Highness on a practice<cf>emergency evacuation from the castle. Safety and<cf>discretion are of the highest importance. I trust<cf>the Arisen can handle such an important task.
Lady Aelinore has fallen into the most dreadful<cf>malaise. She simply must get out of this stuffy old<cf>castle, horrid place it is. Were it up to me, we--<cf><cf>But I digress. Please, Ser Arisen, take milady to a<cf>place of beauty. I'm sure it would lift her spirits.<cf>             —Mirabelle
As I learn more of the Faith and the dragon, I feel<cf>I must be growing stronger... Still, I haven't yet<cf>the courage to travel far on my own. I know I've<cf>asked much of you already, but would you travel<cf>with me a while?
So, something's come up -- minor matter, almost<cf>nothing, don't worry about it -- but it means I<cf>need to take a little trip. You'll come along, won't<cf>you? We had so much fun last time, after all. And<cf>don't worry -- while getting to spend time with<cf>me is its own reward, I'm willing to throw in<cf>something extra to make it worth your while.
I would have us travel together, Arisen. I cannot<cf>disclose details, but trust me that it is a matter<cf>of great interest to your homeland and mine.
This may come to nothing, but...<cf>I aim to join the vanguard, but I must first better<cf>learn my way around Gransys. I would have you<cf>be my guide... You can do this, no?<cf>Don't misunderstand, I'll recompense you for your<cf>time. This is a military exercise, nothing more.
Gran said there were lovely places in this world.<cf>Some, even lovelier than this wood.<cf>Would you show me?
There's a place I'm longing to explore, but it's<cf>filled with far too many beasts for me to handle.<cf>Why don't you come with me, cos? You've grown<cf>so strong, I reckon you could take on anything.<cf>I haven't much to offer in return, but consider it,<cf>would you?
Wanted: a warrior of some strength to serve as<cf>bodyguard for a short journey.
Looking for some company while I run some<cf>errands. The roads get lonely, after all.
Fight it as I might, wanderlust burns hot as<cf>dragon's breath within my breast. All that stays my<cf>departure now is want for a traveling companion.
Just need a guard to get me to the meeting place.
The land where dreams will come true...<cf>That's where I'm headed. Want to come along?
I know not why, just that I must go there.
"Come to me. Offer your prayers, and fortune<cf>will smile upon you..."<cf>'Tis what I was told in that dream I had, Maker's<cf>truth. I reckon it could be rot, but on the other<cf>hand, it could be aught. I'll not rest easy 'til I<cf>know for sure.
"DON'T BE LATE. I'LL BE WAITING."<cf><cf>Someone sent me a letter what said just that!<cf>Against my better judgment, I reckon I'll go...<cf>and bring a burly friend, to boot.

The Arisen must ever strive for greater<cf>heights of skill and valor, that they<cf>may stand against all challenges. Roam<cf>Gransys honing your edge against these<cf>monsters.

I am but a traveling peddler -- one whose<cf>business has taken a sudden and staggering<cf>fall. After consulting a professional, it seems<cf>I've fallen victim to a vile and lingering curse.<cf>My only hope is that it be transferred to<cf>another being. I would ask you find me such<cf>a beast that I may be freed from this torment!
From the Duke's Advisory Council to the<cf>latest brazenly claiming the title of "Arisen" --<cf>Having heard much of your insolence, we<cf>would have you prove whether you are truly<cf>worthy of the great Wyrmking's blessing,<cf>or if you ought to be put down like the<cf>uncultured beast you seem to be.
Every year, more and more animals fall victim<cf>to monster assaults. These unfortunate,<cf>injured beasts go wild in their pain, attacking<cf>indiscriminately. Won't you do the right thing<cf>and put these poor souls out of their misery?

I am soon to be posted to an unfamiliar land,<cf>and mislike the thought of defending a place I<cf>know naught of. I seek a capable companion to<cf>join me in scouting the region.
I would offer a prayer at the resting place of my<cf>fallen brother-in-arms afore I leave on the great<cf>march. An escort would be most welcome.
The oracle warned that I would surely die in the<cf>battle to come if I did not first travel to the<cf>site to dispel the ill fortune that there awaits.<cf>I seek a partner for the journey.
I've been charged with the task of gathering<cf>materials, but do not fancy the thought of<cf>traipsing through lands o'errun with monsters.<cf>I should feel far better with a strong escort<cf>along.
The banquet's planned and the guests invited.<cf>Now all that remains is to fetch the ingredients.<cf>I know where they grow, but I'm like to become<cf>a meal myself if I go to harvest them<cf>unaccompanied.
By order of the Faith, I travel the land<cf>investigating the dragon. I believe I've located<cf>new evidence of academic merit, but require<cf>protection in order to reach it. I pray the Maker<cf>send me a stalwart aide in this matter.
I dearly wish to make a pilgrimage to the site<cf>where the great sage Orinth is said to have<cf>purified the land long ago. All who travel to<cf>this hidden sanctuary are blessed with the<cf>Maker's divine protection. I fear to make the<cf>trip alone, though. Will no one see me safely<cf>there?
A rare scroll from the mainland speaks of a<cf>mystical stone somewhere in our own Gransys<cf>which, with a single touch, can spare a person<cf>of all evils, be it dragonfire, disease, or<cf>destitution. I ask for an escort to find this<cf>fabled rock.
A nice peddler told me of a spot with a view<cf>more grand than any other. I do dearly wish to<cf>see it! Will someone strong and able please see<cf>me there?
This traveling peddler asks the company of a<cf>seasoned escort on the roads.
I've unearthed a map of dubious origins, and it<cf>has me quite perplexed. I cannot help but<cf>believe it lays out the path to aught of value.<cf>Treasure, perhaps. But everyone I've spoken to<cf>laughs it off as folly. I assure you, I am most<cf>serious! Pray, someone escort me to the place it<cf>details!
If I hope to one day make a name for myself in<cf>the duke's army, I shall need valor enough to<cf>brave untold dangers alone. I aim to ease into<cf>such feats by first traveling with an escort.
My world has lost its color and I've no desire to<cf>go on. All I wish is to see that place just once<cf>more ere I go. Pray, someone deliver me there.
I know of a place some leagues removed from<cf>the other mines that houses sands and ore of a<cf>higher caliber, but my pickaxe is ill defense<cf>against monsters. I ask only for protection long<cf>enough to see me to the site.
A peddler keen to keep his skin gifted me with a<cf>treasure map not long ago, and I aim to test its<cf>veracity. 'Tis a fine opportunity to put the new<cf>boys through their paces, what's more. See<cf>them to the map's end, and if any lags or runs<cf>off, see they don't come back.
We've been instructed to ready ourselves for<cf>deployment on a moment's notice by taking<cf>practice marches in our leisure time. I could<cf>well do with the combat practice, but it would<cf>ill serve to get injured. I ask for someone to<cf>accompany me in the field.
I see no sense in erecting walls and holds to<cf>stay a dragon, and even less sense wasting<cf>one's life manning the blighted things. Comes a<cf>time a fellow wants to leave his post and gripe a<cf>while. That's all.
Unless we take up net and rod soon, we'll be<cf>eating sand afore the season's end. But the<cf>shore here remains bedeviled by monsters...<cf>I aim to seek out new fishing waters, but want<cf>for protection to reach them.
The duke's chamberlain requires a reliable<cf>escort to accompany His Highness on a practice<cf>emergency evacuation from the castle. Safety and<cf>discretion are of the highest importance. I trust<cf>the Arisen can handle such an important task.
Lady Aelinore has fallen into the most dreadful<cf>malaise. She simply must get out of this stuffy old<cf>castle, horrid place it is. Were it up to me, we--<cf><cf>But I digress. Please, Ser Arisen, take milady to a<cf>place of beauty. I'm sure it would lift her spirits.<cf>             —Mirabelle
As I learn more of the Faith and the dragon, I feel<cf>I must be growing stronger... Still, I haven't yet<cf>the courage to travel far on my own. I know I've<cf>asked much of you already, but would you travel<cf>with me a while?
So, something's come up -- minor matter, almost<cf>nothing, don't worry about it -- but it means I<cf>need to take a little trip. You'll come along, won't<cf>you? We had so much fun last time, after all. And<cf>don't worry -- while getting to spend time with<cf>me is its own reward, I'm willing to throw in<cf>something extra to make it worth your while.
I would have us travel together, Arisen. I cannot<cf>disclose details, but trust me that it is a matter<cf>of great interest to your homeland and mine.
This may come to nothing, but...<cf>I aim to join the vanguard, but I must first better<cf>learn my way around Gransys. I would have you<cf>be my guide... You can do this, no?<cf>Don't misunderstand, I'll recompense you for your<cf>time. This is a military exercise, nothing more.
Gran said there were lovely places in this world.<cf>Some, even lovelier than this wood.<cf>Would you show me?
There's a place I'm longing to explore, but it's<cf>filled with far too many beasts for me to handle.<cf>Why don't you come with me, cos? You've grown<cf>so strong, I reckon you could take on anything.<cf>I haven't much to offer in return, but consider it,<cf>would you?
Wanted: a warrior of some strength to serve as<cf>bodyguard for a short journey.
Looking for some company while I run some<cf>errands. The roads get lonely, after all.
Fight it as I might, wanderlust burns hot as<cf>dragon's breath within my breast. All that stays my<cf>departure now is want for a traveling companion.
Just need a guard to get me to the meeting place.
The land where dreams will come true...<cf>That's where I'm headed. Want to come along?
I know not why, just that I must go there.
"Come to me. Offer your prayers, and fortune<cf>will smile upon you..."<cf>'Tis what I was told in that dream I had, Maker's<cf>truth. I reckon it could be rot, but on the other<cf>hand, it could be aught. I'll not rest easy 'til I<cf>know for sure.
"DON'T BE LATE. I'LL BE WAITING."<cf><cf>Someone sent me a letter what said just that!<cf>Against my better judgment, I reckon I'll go...<cf>and bring a burly friend, to boot.

This may come to nothing, but...<cf>I aim to join the vanguard, but I must first better<cf>learn my way around Gransys. I would have you<cf>be my guide... You can do this, no?<cf>Don't misunderstand, I'll recompense you for your<cf>time. This is a military exercise, nothing more.
Gran said there were lovely places in this world.<cf>Some, even lovelier than this wood.<cf>Would you show me?
There's a place I'm longing to explore, but it's<cf>filled with far too many beasts for me to handle.<cf>Why don't you come with me, cos? You've grown<cf>so strong, I reckon you could take on anything.<cf>I haven't much to offer in return, but consider it,<cf>would you?
Wanted: a warrior of some strength to serve as<cf>bodyguard for a short journey.
Looking for some company while I run some<cf>errands. The roads get lonely, after all.
Fight it as I might, wanderlust burns hot as<cf>dragon's breath within my breast. All that stays my<cf>departure now is want for a traveling companion.
Just need a guard to get me to the meeting place.
The land where dreams will come true...<cf>That's where I'm headed. Want to come along?
I know not why, just that I must go there.
"Come to me. Offer your prayers, and fortune<cf>will smile upon you..."<cf>'Tis what I was told in that dream I had, Maker's<cf>truth. I reckon it could be rot, but on the other<cf>hand, it could be aught. I'll not rest easy 'til I<cf>know for sure.
"DON'T BE LATE. I'LL BE WAITING."<cf><cf>Someone sent me a letter what said just that!<cf>Against my better judgment, I reckon I'll go...<cf>and bring a burly friend, to boot.
I am soon to be posted to an unfamiliar land,<cf>and mislike the thought of defending a place I<cf>know naught of. I seek a capable companion to<cf>join me in scouting the region.
I would offer a prayer at the resting place of my<cf>fallen brother-in-arms afore I leave on the great<cf>march. An escort would be most welcome.
The oracle warned that I would surely die in the<cf>battle to come if I did not first travel to the<cf>site to dispel the ill fortune that there awaits.<cf>I seek a partner for the journey.
I've been charged with the task of gathering<cf>materials, but do not fancy the thought of<cf>traipsing through lands o'errun with monsters.<cf>I should feel far better with a strong escort<cf>along.
The banquet's planned and the guests invited.<cf>Now all that remains is to fetch the ingredients.<cf>I know where they grow, but I'm like to become<cf>a meal myself if I go to harvest them<cf>unaccompanied.
By order of the Faith, I travel the land<cf>investigating the dragon. I believe I've located<cf>new evidence of academic merit, but require<cf>protection in order to reach it. I pray the Maker<cf>send me a stalwart aide in this matter.
I dearly wish to make a pilgrimage to the site<cf>where the great sage Orinth is said to have<cf>purified the land long ago. All who travel to<cf>this hidden sanctuary are blessed with the<cf>Maker's divine protection. I fear to make the<cf>trip alone, though. Will no one see me safely<cf>there?
A rare scroll from the mainland speaks of a<cf>mystical stone somewhere in our own Gransys<cf>which, with a single touch, can spare a person<cf>of all evils, be it dragonfire, disease, or<cf>destitution. I ask for an escort to find this<cf>fabled rock.
A nice peddler told me of a spot with a view<cf>more grand than any other. I do dearly wish to<cf>see it! Will someone strong and able please see<cf>me there?
This traveling peddler asks the company of a<cf>seasoned escort on the roads.
I've unearthed a map of dubious origins, and it<cf>has me quite perplexed. I cannot help but<cf>believe it lays out the path to aught of value.<cf>Treasure, perhaps. But everyone I've spoken to<cf>laughs it off as folly. I assure you, I am most<cf>serious! Pray, someone escort me to the place it<cf>details!
If I hope to one day make a name for myself in<cf>the duke's army, I shall need valor enough to<cf>brave untold dangers alone. I aim to ease into<cf>such feats by first traveling with an escort.
My world has lost its color and I've no desire to<cf>go on. All I wish is to see that place just once<cf>more ere I go. Pray, someone deliver me there.
I know of a place some leagues removed from<cf>the other mines that houses sands and ore of a<cf>higher caliber, but my pickaxe is ill defense<cf>against monsters. I ask only for protection long<cf>enough to see me to the site.
A peddler keen to keep his skin gifted me with a<cf>treasure map not long ago, and I aim to test its<cf>veracity. 'Tis a fine opportunity to put the new<cf>boys through their paces, what's more. See<cf>them to the map's end, and if any lags or runs<cf>off, see they don't come back.
We've been instructed to ready ourselves for<cf>deployment on a moment's notice by taking<cf>practice marches in our leisure time. I could<cf>well do with the combat practice, but it would<cf>ill serve to get injured. I ask for someone to<cf>accompany me in the field.
I see no sense in erecting walls and holds to<cf>stay a dragon, and even less sense wasting<cf>one's life manning the blighted things. Comes a<cf>time a fellow wants to leave his post and gripe a<cf>while. That's all.
Unless we take up net and rod soon, we'll be<cf>eating sand afore the season's end. But the<cf>shore here remains bedeviled by monsters...<cf>I aim to seek out new fishing waters, but want<cf>for protection to reach them.
The duke's chamberlain requires a reliable<cf>escort to accompany His Highness on a practice<cf>emergency evacuation from the castle. Safety and<cf>discretion are of the highest importance. I trust<cf>the Arisen can handle such an important task.
Lady Aelinore has fallen into the most dreadful<cf>malaise. She simply must get out of this stuffy old<cf>castle, horrid place it is. Were it up to me, we--<cf><cf>But I digress. Please, Ser Arisen, take milady to a<cf>place of beauty. I'm sure it would lift her spirits.<cf>             —Mirabelle
As I learn more of the Faith and the dragon, I feel<cf>I must be growing stronger... Still, I haven't yet<cf>the courage to travel far on my own. I know I've<cf>asked much of you already, but would you travel<cf>with me a while?
So, something's come up -- minor matter, almost<cf>nothing, don't worry about it -- but it means I<cf>need to take a little trip. You'll come along, won't<cf>you?

"Come to me. Offer your prayers, and fortune<cf>will smile upon you..."<cf>'Tis what I was told in that dream I had, Maker's<cf>truth. I reckon it could be rot, but on the other<cf>hand, it could be aught. I'll not rest easy 'til I<cf>know for sure.
"DON'T BE LATE. I'LL BE WAITING."<cf><cf>Someone sent me a letter what said just that!<cf>Against my better judgment, I reckon I'll go...<cf>and bring a burly friend, to boot.
I am soon to be posted to an unfamiliar land,<cf>and mislike the thought of defending a place I<cf>know naught of. I seek a capable companion to<cf>join me in scouting the region.
I would offer a prayer at the resting place of my<cf>fallen brother-in-arms afore I leave on the great<cf>march. An escort would be most welcome.
The oracle warned that I would surely die in the<cf>battle to come if I did not first travel to the<cf>site to dispel the ill fortune that there awaits.<cf>I seek a partner for the journey.
I've been charged with the task of gathering<cf>materials, but do not fancy the thought of<cf>traipsing through lands o'errun with monsters.<cf>I should feel far better with a strong escort<cf>along.
The banquet's planned and the guests invited.<cf>Now all that remains is to fetch the ingredients.<cf>I know where they grow, but I'm like to become<cf>a meal myself if I go to harvest them<cf>unaccompanied.
By order of the Faith, I travel the land<cf>investigating the dragon. I believe I've located<cf>new evidence of academic merit, but require<cf>protection in order to reach it. I pray the Maker<cf>send me a stalwart aide in this matter.
I dearly wish to make a pilgrimage to the site<cf>where the great sage Orinth is said to have<cf>purified the land long ago. All who travel to<cf>this hidden sanctuary are blessed with the<cf>Maker's divine protection. I fear to make the<cf>trip alone, though. Will no one see me safely<cf>there?
A rare scroll from the mainland speaks of a<cf>mystical stone somewhere in our own Gransys<cf>which, with a single touch, can spare a person<cf>of all evils, be it dragonfire, disease, or<cf>destitution. I ask for an escort to find this<cf>fabled rock.
A nice peddler told me of a spot with a view<cf>more grand than any other. I do dearly wish to<cf>see it! Will someone strong and able please see<cf>me there?
This traveling peddler asks the company of a<cf>seasoned escort on the roads.
I've unearthed a map of dubious origins, and it<cf>has me quite perplexed. I cannot help but<cf>believe it lays out the path to aught of value.<cf>Treasure, perhaps. But everyone I've spoken to<cf>laughs it off as folly. I assure you, I am most<cf>serious! Pray, someone escort me to the place it<cf>details!
If I hope to one day make a name for myself in<cf>the duke's army, I shall need valor enough to<cf>brave untold dangers alone. I aim to ease into<cf>such feats by first traveling with an escort.
My world has lost its color and I've no desire to<cf>go on. All I wish is to see that place just once<cf>more ere I go. Pray, someone deliver me there.
I know of a place some leagues removed from<cf>the other mines that houses sands and ore of a<cf>higher caliber, but my pickaxe is ill defense<cf>against monsters. I ask only for protection long<cf>enough to see me to the site.
A peddler keen to keep his skin gifted me with a<cf>treasure map not long ago, and I aim to test its<cf>veracity. 'Tis a fine opportunity to put the new<cf>boys through their paces, what's more. See<cf>them to the map's end, and if any lags or runs<cf>off, see they don't come back.
We've been instructed to ready ourselves for<cf>deployment on a moment's notice by taking<cf>practice marches in our leisure time. I could<cf>well do with the combat practice, but it would<cf>ill serve to get injured. I ask for someone to<cf>accompany me in the field.
I see no sense in erecting walls and holds to<cf>stay a dragon, and even less sense wasting<cf>one's life manning the blighted things. Comes a<cf>time a fellow wants to leave his post and gripe a<cf>while. That's all.
Unless we take up net and rod soon, we'll be<cf>eating sand afore the season's end. But the<cf>shore here remains bedeviled by monsters...<cf>I aim to seek out new fishing waters, but want<cf>for protection to reach them.
The duke's chamberlain requires a reliable<cf>escort to accompany His Highness on a practice<cf>emergency evacuation from the castle. Safety and<cf>discretion are of the highest importance. I trust<cf>the Arisen can handle such an important task.
Lady Aelinore has fallen into the most dreadful<cf>malaise. She simply must get out of this stuffy old<cf>castle, horrid place it is. Were it up to me, we--<cf><cf>But I digress. Please, Ser Arisen, take milady to a<cf>place of beauty. I'm sure it would lift her spirits.<cf>             —Mirabelle
As I learn more of the Faith and the dragon, I feel<cf>I must be growing stronger... Still, I haven't yet<cf>the courage to travel far on my own. I know I've<cf>asked much of you already, but would you travel<cf>with me a while?
So, something's come up -- minor matter, almost<cf>nothing, don't worry about it -- but it means I<cf>need to take a little trip. You'll come along, won't<cf>you? We had so much fun last time, after all. And<cf>don't worry -- while getting to spend time with<cf>me is its own reward, I'm willing to throw in<cf>something extra to make it worth your while.
I would have us travel together, Arisen. I cannot<cf>disclose details, but trust me that it is a matter<cf>of great interest to your homeland and mine.
This may come to nothing, but...<cf>I aim to join the vanguard, but I must first better<cf>learn my way around Gransys. I would have you<cf>be my guide... You can do this, no?<cf>Don't misunderstand, I'll recompense you for your<cf>time. This is a military exercise, nothing more.
Gran said there were lovely places in this world.<cf>Some, even lovelier than this wood.<cf>Would you show me?
There's a place I'm longing to explore, but it's<cf>filled with far too many beasts for me to handle.<cf>Why don't you come with me, cos? You've grown<cf>so strong, I reckon you could take on anything.<cf>I haven't much to offer in return, but consider it,<cf>would you?
Wanted: a warrior of some strength to serve as<cf>bodyguard for a short journey.
Looking for some company while I run some<cf>errands. The roads get lonely, after all.
Fight it as I might, wanderlust burns hot as<cf>dragon's breath within my breast. All that stays my<cf>departure now is want for a traveling companion.
Just need a guard to get me to the meeting place.

The riftstones you see are not eternal. As<cf>Arisen and pawns use them, age after age,<cf>time takes its toll...the slabs crumble, their<cf>otherworldly light solidifying into small<cf>medallions.

In this darkness, it is your bonds with<cf>others that will guide you. Mayhap meeting<cf>with one of your predecessors will<cf>illuminate the path ahead? Seek out another<cf>acquainted with the dragon as you are.
The darkness here can befog the eyes of even<cf>the Arisen. When you find aught you cannot<cf>fathom, bring it to one who has the eyes to<cf>descry it.
This darkness may put a man on his mettle,<cf>but it is not entirely without pity. If<cf>you've armaments tempered in wyrmfire, bring<cf>them to one gone before you, that they may<cf>unlock the power trapped within.
Fie and curse this place... Am I to live out<cf>my days in this fetid pit? No! I've not<cf>given up. Just as despair's icy grip was<cf>taking hold, I had a divine revelation! One<cf>thin strand of hope...I must find more of<cf>them! Yes, of course! They're the only way<cf>out of this wretched labyrinth...<cf>I must have more of the Macabre Sculptures!
If I can just collect the blasted<cf>sculptures, something will happen. I know<cf>they're the key to getting out of here...<cf>I know it as sure as my own name! And yet...<cf>the exhilaration I once felt is fading<cf>fast... How many of the damnable things must<cf>I find? Am I a fool for hanging my hopes<cf>upon them so?
I've assembled a veritable collection, and<cf>for what? Nothing has happened! Nothing!<cf>Need I find more still...? Mayhap it was a<cf>ploy all along... A false hope to crush what<cf>little belief I had left... Well there's no<cf>escaping the snare now. If it be a fool's<cf>errand, then this fool will see it through.<cf>These damned sculptures are all I have left.
I call upon you, wanderer of the abyss.<cf>I call upon you, lost and witless human.<cf>You will bring me what I seek, and I will<cf>grant a boon to aid you on your travels.
To you, traveler from a place and time far <cf>distant, bearing the selfsame auspice carved<cf>upon your breast, I offer these words: Long<cf>have I toiled here in search of an answer,<cf>and now I have found it. I am eager to guide<cf>you to this path, but first I must see proof<cf>of your mettle. Slay the beasts that feed on<cf>corpses to show me your strength.
The more monsters I hunt here, the more <cf>uneasy I become. Beneath deepening feelings <cf>of despair and resignation, a strange sense <cf>of anticipation simmers. Could this be the <cf>pull of some presence here? I can but<cf>follow the whims of my restive heart, as it<cf>bids me wander this place in search of foes.<cf>I urge you to chart the selfsame course.
I have a boon to ask of you who read this,<cf>as I presume that you are Arisen, same as I.<cf>'Tis my honor to serve as grand chamberlain <cf>to His Youthful Majesty, King Arsemus II, <cf>the realm's beloved Emerald King.<cf>There's a deed must be done, for love of <cf>king and kingdom. I beg you, good fellow.<cf>Will you help?
Our ill-fortuned king, enthroned at the age<cf>of seven, now lies abed, sickened and<cf>struggling for life. Alas, the senate has<cf>never looked fondly upon His Majesty's <cf>ascension, and plots to see him fall to this<cf>disease. I found a formula for a curative,<cf>but I desperately need monsters slain so <cf>that the ingredients can be gathered.
I call upon you, wanderer of the abyss.<cf>I call upon you, lost and witless human.<cf>You may topple the labyrinth's lord, but<cf>that will not reveal the way to the light.<cf>You must see through the lies, and open the<cf>path of blood that leads to me.
I call upon you, wanderer of the abyss.<cf>I call upon you, lost and witless human.<cf>You will gather the epitaphs left by those<cf>who came before you -- signposts on the<cf>road you would travel.
As grand chamberlain, 'tis my duty sworn to <cf>protect His Majesty and foil the senate's <cf>intrigue. Alas, on the first eve I set out<cf>to subdue monsters and acquire ingredients<cf>for His Majesty's curative, I find myself<cf>astray in this labyrinth! Scant time<cf>remains, so I beseech you to continue the<cf>task of culling the creatures in my stead.
The fate of my realm, the life of my king...<cf>I would gladly part with this flawed vessel<cf>to protect them. 'Twas only for king and<cf>kingdom that I became Arisen, but now it<cf>seems that all I am is to be lost. And so<cf>it is to you, Arisen of a distant land, that<cf>I entrust my errand, and the future of my<cf>king and my country along with it...
I call upon you, wanderer of the abyss.<cf>I call upon you, lost and witless human.<cf>You will bring me what I seek, and I will<cf>grant a boon to aid you on your travels.
Can you hear me, Arisen? Even without a <cf>heart, our blood can still boil, our <cf>undying bodies roiling like storm clouds...<cf>We are butchers, you and I, and whatever<cf>pretense we might carry will never wash away<cf>the stench of blood and death from our<cf>hands. So let us not deny our true nature,<cf>but embrace it with a test of will!
What a giant! I'd long considered myself an<cf>authority on cyclopes, but this labyrinth<cf>has twisted the foul creatures to unimagined<cf>depths of grotesquery. I can ill understand<cf>the joy I felt to breathe the deathly stench<cf>of the creature; 'twas not courage or fear,<cf>but some aspiration that lit within me.<cf>I would have you feel the same rapture!
I call upon you, wanderer of the abyss.<cf>I call upon you, lost and witless human.<cf>You will bring me what I seek, and I will<cf>grant a boon to aid you on your travels.
Enjoying your time in this crucible?<cf>The ecstasy of slaughter...killing as you<cf>please, all behind the sterling shield of<cf>duty... How gratifying to finally slake your<cf>thirst for bloodshed and destruction, eh!?<cf>Oh, you feel I have you wrong, do you?<cf>Then why plow onward? Why not halt your<cf>advance? Come now. You know the reason...
A land of slaughter without end...<cf>If eternal paradise exists, this is it.<cf>'Tis only when my foe breathes its last <cf>that I feel truly alive, and in this idyll, <cf>I relive that moment time and again. Truly, <cf>I am grateful to he who made me an Arisen, <cf>led me here, and gave me a death richer in <cf>meaning than my entire worthless life!
Death frees the spirit for its cycle of<cf>rebirth, only to have it lost in a vast sea<cf>of other screaming souls. Why meekly submit<cf>to this fate? I have cast away the shackles<cf>of the Arisen. In form and function, I have<cf>embraced my calling...as death. Let me be<cf>your paragon of perfection! Let me be your<cf>beacon of hope! 
I call upon you, wanderer of the abyss.<cf>I call upon you, lost and witless human.<cf>You will bring me what I seek, and I will<cf>grant a boon to aid you on your travels.
In the name of the mighty conqueror,<cf>King Theodore the Bold, you are hereby<cf>ordered to offer up the corpse of a<cf>dragon of thunder in tribute.
In the name of the mighty conqueror,<cf>King Theodore the Bold, you are hereby<cf>ordered to offer up the corpse of a<cf>dragon of ice in tribute.
In the name of the mighty conqueror,<cf>King Theodore the Bold, you are hereby<cf>ordered to offer up the corpse of a<cf>dragon of flame in tribute.
Masterfully done. But the trial does not end there.
The Arisen must possess the valor to stand against all threats, and the power to quell them.
A tireless spirit of self-improvement grants the strength to lead the legion. Pray, show it now.
Salvation? Damn the lot of them.
And their idle talk of destruction and redemption. They were convenient to my purpose, nothing more.
The day of Edmun Dragonsbane is past. He will not slay another wyrm.
So what cause is served by sending men to die for his pleasure?
A swift death for Gransys is the greatest mercy to her neighbors.
Pray, think of the morrow.
The dragon will come again. To your homeland, and to mine.
Who shall stand against it then if we are spent, all of us, for having held to some ancient pact?
What is gained by all our deaths? Naught, I say. ...And naught would say your lord father.
You know it to be true!
Has he sent his finest blades? A general fit to lead them?
No, he's sent an ornament, though she be too daft to see it. 'Tis an empty show, woman!
I've no more patience to indulge your play at knighthood, little girl.
Your failure to quell the revolt is cause enough to run home to Hearthstone, tail twixt your legs.
I tell you this in the spirit of mercy: If you cannot best me, you cannot best the dragon. Run along home while you yet live.
Do you think me cruel, Arisen? 'Tis a sorry truth that righteousness is a rare luxury in war.
You are pledged to slay the wyrm, and that alone.
No oath binds you to the duke, nor would my death do you any great service.
There are those might call me a monster, but I am no dragon, ser. ...What say you?
I am bested, ser...
Slain by your hand, and brought back as well...
Such utter defeat ill leaves room for argument.
I shall return to the capital and place myself at the mercy of the court.
They will have my confession, and my head, should they wish it... And you shall have the glory, ser.
Worry not, I've no design on running. Even as I am, I've some semblance of pride.
I leave you with a word of warning:
The revolt was but a diversion. The killing blow will be delivered elsewhere... Pay heed, ser.
Do you think me a fool for coming back? For not running?
...Perhaps I am. In truth, I hardly know my own reasons.
I cannot think the duke has any hope of victory in his campaign against the dragon...
I thought it a mercy to speed the land to its downfall, and so I sowed dissent.
Better that men-at-arms turn and run than stand and die. With them gone, the people, too, would flee.
I was sure it the best way. The only way... Until I came to know you, ser.
You brought doubt with you. Perhaps... Perhaps you might yet best the dragon, I thought.
'Tis a strange thing, to find such hope unwelcome.
Enough. Pray, leave this place. It ill serves you to linger here.
Take this token, for your troubles. I have little need for such possessions now. Take all I have...
All of it, save one thing: the ring you gave to me. Surely a dying man may be forgiven one remembrance.
Take it, Arisen, and go.
Pray that my sentence is stayed long enough that I may hear my fool's hope confirmed.
A ring? You mean me to wear it?
Do you quite realize the meaning of such an act, ser?
...I'll not decline it, mind. A favor from the Arisen is a great honor indeed.
My thanks.
Bah, I'm barely scratched. I've work to be--
Ah, goodfisher! I am seaworthy again, and well glad of it.
No man of the sea ought die on solid ground. You've my thanks for sparing me that fate!
Where there's life, there's hope, or so the saying goes... Aye, I ought be thankful.
Don't cross me.
Keep moving.
Hungry for a fight?
Strike fast an' hard!
That one!
Half-wit!

'Tis locked. You haven't the key to fit it...
'Tis caught on something. Perhaps it could open from the far side.
'Tis barred shut. Might be able to break the bolt.
'Tis shut tight.
'Tis no use at this hour. You'll have to come again later.
Best stop for now.
Seems they're closed.
Someone was here...
Lost them...
Gone...
Perhaps you've upset them.
There's naught to do here.
Best you moved on.
Not here...
The door is closed.
Shows no sign of opening.
There's aught there...
You don't see anything.
That smell...
Someone's near...
What's this...?
Fine view from here.
There's aught written here...
Must be a way to find something...
Smells delicious.
Perfect spot to place something.
You can almost reach...
There appears to be aught ahead.
That fall could kill.
'Tis dangerous to touch.
A strong blow might break it.
Perhaps if you came by night.
Perhaps if you came by day.
Perhaps if you came at dawn.
Perhaps if you came at dusk.
There's aught buried here...
You see no way up.
'Tis slick, this spot.
No use pressing any further.
No need to double back further.
No time for that now.
You cannot carry any more.
There may yet be aught lying about.
Seems there's naught you can take on at present.<cf>Best to try again later.
Perhaps with a bit of help...
Best you kept your weapon sheathed.
Is someone here...?
'Tis a place for tall folk.
'Tis a place for small folk.
Had you a woman in your band...
Had you a man in your band...
Had you a strong companion...
Had you a swift companion...
Had you a magick user...
Had you an apt climber...
Had you a skilled jumper...
This weapon will not help you.
That armor won't protect you.
You're ill equipped for this.
Seems it can't be used now.
You'll get no further use from it.
'Tis useless, now.
Hmm, not with your current equipment...
Not with your current party...
You hear aught from further in.
Enemies... They're close.
Best you got some rest.
You can carry no more!
You're too exhausted!
"Danger! Keep Out!"
"No Trespassing"
A sign.
Had you an Empty Flask, you might fill it here.
You'll get no further without a lantern.
'Tis dangerous to fumble about in the dark. Best find a light.
Best not just leave them.
If aught were left here, it would rot.
Best take care you don't get lost.
Best check the map.
You're due for a rest.
This place is dangerous by night.
This place is dangerous by day.
Breathtaking...
You'll get no further!
Seems you'll need to come back.
Nothing left here.
It looks fit to crumble.
Seems it could be moved...
It will not budge.
It will not open.
Seems you need a key.
Seems you need a Pickaxe here.
You yet lack the experience.
You yet lack the skill.
Not with your current vocation...
You'll not pass through this gate.
You've no time!
Seems you were too late.
You may make it, yet.
You're doing well for time.
Seems you've come at the wrong time.
There may be another path.
'Tis a wall of rubble... You'll not get through it.
'Tis cracked. Perhaps a strong blow would send it down.
Locked, and by a special key. Most like one of the men here could have it open.
'Tis locked. The soldier on the far side's doing, no doubt.

<TUTO>Press <SIZE 25><ICON ATTACK0></SIZE> or <SIZE 25><ICON ATTACK1></SIZE> to change arrows.
A Ferrystone will spirit you back to Gran<cf>Soren in an instant, no matter where you<cf>are located.
It is by far the fastest and safest method<cf>of travel, but each stone disappears after<cf>a single use.
You can equip yourself with a primary and<cf>a secondary weapon.
Primary weapons such as swords and daggers<cf>are combat essentials. Secondary weapons<cf>like bows and shields offer support.
In addition to weapons and armor, you can<cf>also equip accoutrements with certain special<cf>abilities to give you an edge in battle.
Only one piece of jewelry and a single<cf>cloak can be equipped as accoutrements<cf>at any one time.
A heavy load will cause your Stamina to<cf>deplete more quickly. Sell or discard<cf>any and all items you no longer need.
Your lantern consumes oil. If it dims,<cf>use a Flask of Oil to refill it.
Some items can be combined with others to<cf>produce surprising results. Experiment and<cf>see what you come up with. 
Place waypoint markers on your map to<cf>keep track of your progress.
If you've forgotten where you are in the story,<cf>select "Chronicle" from the Pause Menu to<cf>review a history of your journey thus far.
Select "Options" from the Pause Menu to<cf>customize your mini-map and status display.
The higher the fall, the more damage you<cf>will suffer.
Note that you move somewhat slower while<cf>your weapon is drawn.
Exhausting all Stamina will make you unable<cf>to act for a time. Take care to conserve<cf>energy!
You can attack while clinging to foes.
Petrifaction cannot be cured by normal<cf>magick, and is fatal if left untreated.
Use Secret Softener or the like to<cf>cure any petrified allies.
Your rank within a vocation rises as you<cf>defeat foes and complete quests. At higher<cf>ranks, a broader variety of skills are available.
Defeating foes and completing quests earns<cf>you more discipline, boosting your prowess<cf>in a vocation.
Pawns will collect and use items of their<cf>own volition.
You cannot carry or purchase items that<cf>would cause you to exceed your maximum<cf>encumbrance.
Press <TUTO><SIZE 25><ICON TOUCH></SIZE> while climbing down a ladder<cf>to descend quickly. 
If a pawn remains unconscious for too long,<cf>they will be forfeit.
Your support pawn has become forfeit, and<cf>returned to the realm whence they came.
Your main pawn has become forfeit,<cf>disappearing and returning to the rift.
You cannot join covenants with other pawns<cf>while your main pawn is forfeit.
Touch any riftstone to return your lost<cf>main pawn to your side.
If a support pawn is forfeit, any items<cf>they were carrying are sent to item storage.
You can send off departing pawns with a<cf>single item as a gift for their creator.
You can pass items to and from your pawns<cf>on the sub menu.
State your business!
Who goes there!?
Where d'you think you're going?
Halt!
You'll go no farther!
M-my deepest apologies...
What brings you here, ser?
I cannot allow even the Arisen to pass unbidden.
I would thank you to refrain from such actions in the future, ser...
There are many like me here... Pawns bereft of their masters.
Abandoned as we are by death, we can but wait, adrift in endless desolation...
Then you have come... Very well, Arisen.
I am Grigori, devourer of a thousand worlds, nemesis of five hundred score Arisen.
Lay your pitiable life at my feet!
Cede your life to me…
Accept your fate.
Arisen... I know you well.
You would rise against me once more?
And so it e'er shall be…
You are not worthy.
You... Truly, you are worthy…
Even I cannot stay you…
Go, and face what lies beyond…
Madness calls, my puppet…
Madeleine? The young woman what ran the shop?
Bolted past this very spot but a short time ago. 
Quite the beauty, that one! Most like she was trying to lose some suitor come for her hand, eh? Heh heh.
'Course, I've heard talk about her in some troubles... Might be she was fleeing the Guard. 
Ngh!
Oof!
Aaaaagh...
Yah!
Hahh!
Hello.
If you'll excuse me.
Yes.
Well...
Thank you.
I could hardly be happier.
...Yes?
Is there something else?
This world is rife with war, is it not?
Our mission in life is to serve you, Arisen.
This pawn shall follow you to the world's end, if that is your wish.
If I can do anything to aid your journey, just say the word.
Choose your traveling companions carefully.
Now as always, we pawns can but follow your will, Arisen.
Yes, Arisen?

If you should ever need anything else, do not hesitate to let me know.
Ah...I see.
Then, I bid you farewell.
Very well.
Shall I take back a message?
'Twas well worth the effort!
This pawn stands proud of what we<cf>accomplished.
This pawn is joyed to hear it, Master.
Next time, I'll work harder still.
I'd hoped to serve you adequately...
This pawn shall take greater care<cf>the next time.
I see I've much left to learn.
I served as best I know how...<cf>My apologies.
I had best be going, then.
May our paths cross again.
Summoned pawns do not gain levels, you know.
Instead of experience, they earn rift crystals for whomever created them.
When a summoned pawn's covenant ends, and they leave the party...
They return to their creator with all<cf>the equipment and items they carry.
If no suitable pawns are at hand, simply access the rift pedestal.
Through it, pawns can be sought out and summoned.
Should a particular pawn catch your eye, speak with them to enlist them to your party.
'Tis the role of all pawns to serve Arisen. I will ever have your back, and you may hire and dismiss others at will.
Only two more can join our party at any one time, however.
Seek out the rift, Arisen.
I fear we cannot yet join a covenant.
I am honored to travel with you.
I fear you haven't enough.
You cannot take on any more followers without releasing one of your current companions.
Switch in this pawn
Keep my party as-is
Are you sure you wish me to go? I will take the items and equipment I carry with me.
Go
Stay
Are you sure you wish me to go? I will take the items and equipment I carry back to my own master.
Go

Are you sure you wish me to go?
Go

Understood.
That went well enough.

What serpent grows to such a size...!?
Nothing should have that many heads!
Hydra!
A hydra? Here!?
Hydras...why did it have to be hydras?
If we can't slay it, perhaps we<cf>can drive it off...
Arisen -- with your help we can prove<cf>our might. Let us ward off the beast!
Tis a powerful foe! Be careful!
Its tail is a mighty whip! Beware!
It aims to eat us! Look out!
You'll not take me...!
I'm no beast's meal...!
N-no...!
Steady, Arisen! I'm coming!
You cannot let it win!
On my way, master! Be strong!
There's no place to hide from that<cf>multi-headed serpent!
It attacks from all quarters!<cf>Look sharp!
Its heads rear up just before it attacks!
Rush in and grab hold of its neck --<cf>it's risky but might work!
Let's be rid of that head!
Focus on the wounded head! Cleave<cf>it free!
Sever each head, one after the<cf>next!
Cut deep enough and we'll cleave<cf>that head clean off!
Hack the heads off and it's a<cf>common snake!
Give it a taste of a Salamander's<cf>Tail!
If it hungers so, feed it an explosive!
Once it's swallowed the bomb,<cf>we need only set it off!
Take aim for the bomb it's<cf>swallowed!
Strike its faces! 'Tis exposed as<cf>it reels from the blow!
The head's grown back!
No... The head's regrown!?
Another head...!?
The scales upon its body give<cf>blades no purchase!
Tis too dangerous to get close!<cf>I'll strike from afar!
I'll weaken it with bowfire!
Aiming for its neck!
The head or the throat! Waste no<cf>time on anything else!
Strike its head to stun it, then go<cf>for the throat!
Focus on its neck!<cf>Cleave its head right off!
I'll cut its head from its body!
Land a blow on its head to stun it!
I'll strike its head! Take its<cf>throat as it reels!
I'll hit the head! When it reels,<cf>strike its neck!
I've cleft its head from its body!
Its head is hewn from its frame!
It cannot attack! The beast is ours!
I'll attack until it strikes again!
It lies still!
It reels!
Its throat is unprotected!
Cleave free its head!
Now -- sever its head!
I'll grab hold of it!
I'll strike at its neck from here!
Good... Which head is next!?
Hydra!
A knot of hydras!
There, Master! Hydras!
Look out! A hydra!
Archydra!
A knot of archydras!
There, Master! archydras!
There! An archydra!
A four-headed serpent!
H-hydra!
I cannot think of a less welcome foe...
I'll focus on that head!
Strike the necks, not the body!
Climb the neck!
Now to climb its neck and strike!
A blade might sever its heads!
I'll train my blade on its neck!
Now! Put the oil to fire!
I'll heave you -- grab hold of its head!
I'll hoist you at its head! Strike hard!
I'll feed it an explosive!
Now! Strike its head!
Let's have its head! Hurry!
I'll strike its head!
Arisen! Hurry -- the head!
We must help! Quickly, the head!
No! Attack the head!<cf>There's still time!
There's time yet! Cleave off its head!
Sear the wound shut with fire!
It cannot heal a wound burnt closed!
Seal the wound with a flame!
I'll cleave its head free!
Aim for the tip of its head!
Do not go quietly! Keep struggling!
Aim for the bulge in its throat!
Roast its wounds to slow its healing.
If we can but cleave off all its heads...
No... A hydra! Pray, be careful!
Its heads work in unison!
Its heads grow back too quickly!
An archydra! 'Tis a deadly foe!
That is no mere hydra!
Its scales make a mockery<cf>of our weapons!
Four heads...
There... 'Tis that monster again!
I curse the luck that brought<cf>us this beast...
Now! Climb its neck!
Hrngh!
I'd wager not many truly believe that cult's talk of destruction being renewal.
But we all have need to vent our problems, aye? And the poorest folk doubly so.
They attend Salvation's gatherings to forget their woes for a spell, seems to me.
You've got a shine to your eye... Here, let's have a proper look at you.
Not bad...
You'll be knowing of us, then? Aye, we're thieves...
We do as we please. 'Tis the draw to this life, really. My girls are free to do whatever they like, save disobey my orders.
There's aught about you appeals to me... What say you join us?
You will, aye?
Join them
Not now
Well said! Aye, you'd be a fool not to!
Now, let's see a bit of coin to mark the occasion. Just leave all you've got.
'Tis only fitting as a show of good faith, am I right?
Of course.
Absolutely not.
You've strange taste in jests, friend.
If you're not of us, you're the enemy. We'll sort you out in time... Good luck.
What is it? What more do you want?
I've a powerful hate of the roundabout. Make up your mind.
Join them
Not now
I'd not thought you so rich! 'Tis a fine haul.
Yes...I like you, friend. I like you well.
...That's a sorry sight. Ah, I'll take it just the same.
I like you, friend. I like you well.
Come again? You'll not get aught for nothing, friend.
Don't waste my time. Go.
So? What of that coin, then? Are you paying, or no?
Yea or nay, I care not, but speak up. I hate those that waste my time.
Pay
Don't pay
Now that you're one of us, it's time you did a bit of work.
There's another band of thieves comes 'round these parts. A haughty bunch, for rats.
And their feckless fop of a leader's always blathering on some philosopher's drivel of manners and will and all...
Go and pound the pride out of a few of them, aye?
Quit your dallying about. Go and do for those other bandits already.
I hear we're rid of a few of those rats, thanks to you.
You've got fire in you, and a strong arm to match. I like it.
From here on, you're family.
If you ever have need of us, come and see me. We'll do all we can.
One of my girls tells me you fed my cyclops.
She said the creature took to you warmly. ...For true?
I'd thought I might be the only one he'd suffer gladly, but you too, aye?
I like it. Like you! From this day on, you're family.
If you ever have need of us, come and see me. We'll do all we can.

What? Fournival stands trial? ...'Tis a pity.
In truth, the man was profligate. His ostentation earned him envy and enmity in equal parts.
But he was not the sort of man to seek profit in the misfortunes of others.
I will add my name to the petition.
I shall pray that his innocence is proven.
I thank you for your efforts in petitioning Fournival's acquittal.
Man judges his brother and so the law is kept, but true judgment is the province of the Maker alone.
Fournival's met with an inquest? 'Tis past time the law caught up with that rat.
I'll not forget the pain he caused me as long as I live. The caitiff put my house to ruin!
I shall sleep better anights knowing no others will suffer the same fate. Let him rot.
I gladly commit my name to the petition for his conviction.
I pray my contribution will serve some use, ser.
May Fournival be judged for his misdeeds...
What will become of his daughter?
No...
I am the void of stygian black. I am wonder and despair. I am annihilation.
You stood tall against my Nameless Men, Arisen.
But you will find my challenge of a different caliber. I am the great darkness -- part of every thing, part of every one...
And I am your doom.
Heh heh... I see you now...for a true...Arisen...
Use a Wakestone?
 


 




Restart from the point you last saved the game.
Restart from the last automatically-saved checkpoint.
Return to the title screen.
You will return to the last auto-save at an inn or rift.<cf>Any progress made past that checkpoint will be lost. <cf>Proceed?
This will exit the game and return to the title screen.<cf>All unsaved data will be lost.<cf>Proceed?
Restart from the point you last saved the game<cf>on Normal Mode.
If you switch back to Hard Mode later, you will<cf>restart the game from the beginning, but with all<cf>of the data from your last saved game. Continue?
I am Mercedes. I lead the men of the Enlistment Corps.
I've heard talk of the Arisen. They say you hold dominion over the pawns.
I've ordered pawns to take up swords and fight myself, but they are a clumsy lot.
I cannot call them into this world as you do, though, nor make traveling companions of them.
What manner of magick lets you command them so?
...Well, it matters not.
The dragon is come. I'll welcome any help, be it pawn, Arisen, farmer or fishwife.
Make use of the encampment as you please. Are you in need<cf>of rest?
Rest
Not now
As you will. Repose is the better part of readiness.
Well, come again whenever you tire.
The Corps will remain here awhile. Once more men have gathered, we'll leave for the capital.
Until then, you're free to use our lodgings. Will you rest?
Rest
Not now
The rumors of your strength spoke true. And your mastery over the pawns...
I'd thought them little more than flesh armor -- living shields for human folk.
In any case, the duke will want to know of this attack.
I'd hoped to gather a larger force before leaving for the capital...
But a hydra's head and the Arisen who claimed it make up the difference amply.
We'll have need of a cart to tow the beast's head. Have one of my men seek one out.
Arisen, I see better now from whence the legends arose.
Good judgment, swift footwork... Impressive, truly.
In any case, the duke will want to know of this attack.

Arisen -- use that!

I cannot say what the pass may hold. You'll need your strength.
'Twill be slow going with a cart. I daresay you'll have no trouble catching up.
Accept
Not now
We'll meet at the waycastle. Till then, I bid you rest well. 'Tis a long road ahead.
What, you have some business here yet?
Time is scarce. A rotten head makes for a poor trophy.
Newly Arisen
Your relief at surviving the nightmare is tinged with<cf>a sense of unease. Make ready your equipment and<cf>see to the village.

Have you seen Cortese, cousin?
I've not seen my brother since the dragon came. He's not among the injured, either...
What? Cortese is found!?
...<cf>I... I see.
Elvar has suffered in this as well...
Cortese made his choice. He faced his end with valor, and died<cf>a man.
Elvar bears no fault in that. He's no cause to blame himself.
My thanks, goodfisher... I am sorry this burden fell upon you.<cf>I shall go and put Elvar at ease.
You needn't fret over me, cos. I'm well enough.
Be a sight better once Cortese's grave is built, and our grief has a place to rest.
Elvar and I finished Cortese's grave, cos. Say a prayer afore you go, aye?
Guh.
Gwaugh!
Aaaaugh...
Ho.
Hraah!
Greetings.
Fare well, then.
Oh, yes.
I don't think so...
Oh, thank you.
I'm in your debt, ser. Truly.
As if we hadn't cause enough to worry already...
I understand His Grace was an Arisen himself, but still...
I cannot consider entrusting important work to a total stranger anything but ill-advised.
Not that I bear you any malice, mind, nor that I suspect you especially.
But there have been those who claim in false to be Arisen in the past.
My reservations notwithstanding, you'll get your orders from Aldous.
Take it up with him.
I was wrong to doubt you, ser. You've proven a remarkable asset. Pray, forgive me.
Judging from your feats, I'll warrant you're an Arisen in truth.
Hold this pace and you'll soon be the hero who saved Gransys from the wyrm.
Frankly, though I ought not say it aloud, the duchy's affairs are a right mess of late.
With a bit of luck, you might find yourself sitting the duke's seat once the dragon's been sorted.
People are changed, now the dragon's awake.
Yesterday's stalwarts today eye the door -- a few have fled<cf>already.
It is a testament to how far our hearts have drifted from His Grace.
Still, I'm fain to stay a while yet.
I'll take odds you slay the beast and ride back to us a hero.
I'm in your debt, ser. Truly.
Ngh!
Grah!
Gwaaaagh...
Gya!
Graaagh!
Are you well?
Take care.
Of course.
I don't know...
Mm, thanks.
I owe you for that.
That cursed dragon... Scattered our pier into kindling!
I'll not have the beast shackle me in low spirits. The men of Cassardis are made of stronger stuff.
Not like those soft shoes over in Gran Soren! One whiff of dragon and they scatter like virgins at the alehouse.
Life's a harsh thing, and those who live it best make tragedy fast forgot.
Our fair tavern has swung wide the doors once more.
A frothy mug and lively talk are just the things to show that dragon our courage.
If that winged bastard darkens our skies again, I'll have his bollocks for a trophy!
Pair'a dragon balls would look right fancy over my hearth, no?
Heard you've got yourself a few pawns to shove around, eh?
I've one thing to say on them pawns: They ain't from the Maker, and I don't trust 'em!
...I suppose that was two things. 
They say the pawns spawn whenever times are dire...
To hear some tell it, they come to aid us, but I'll believe that when I see it...and maybe not even then.
The Hydra's that beast what looks all serpent-like, yeah?
I spy any of them hydras slithering about, I'll cleave his head and take his fangs for spoons!
Old folk say any land sees the dragon is cursed to fall. 
The more I hear talk of that sort, the more I drink to forget it.
Been off in the capital, have you? Little wonder you're scarce of late.
Well? What's the good word from Gran Soren, then?
Them garter-wearing fancies pissing 'emselves at the thought of the dragon, no doubt! Haw haw!
City folk all got horses and coin, yeah? Figured they'd all be run for the hills by now.
About that favor, cos? No need, now.
Well, spear me in the sack! They say you've gone and become a rose!
Arosen... Arisen! Any case, you're the talk of the tavern, cousin. Way folks carry on, you walk on water and you shoot fire from your arse.
That dragon comes back, I'm the first you should turn to for help. 
I'd pay him back double for what he done to us.
Just forget I spoke of it, aye?
Well, well. Look who's taking orders from the duke 'imself.
Just remember us poor fisherfolk when you're done, eh? Haw haw!
Best the dragon, and they'll name you duke. Then it's nothin' but fancy ale and golden silks till your final day.
So, what word of the capital?
A traveller told me madmen renounced the Faith and mean to overthrow the duke. Even His Grace's soldiers can't be trusted...
If that's the life the city offers, I'll stay right here, thank you kindly.
Some left the village, you know. Afore, I named them craven. But now...
My words are bold, yet... In truth, when I heard first of the dragon, it set my knees to tremble.
It troubles me even to weigh thoughts of deserting the village where I was raised from a minnow...
For my own cause, I could fight... But I have a wife and child. When I think of them...
I'm...I'm sorry, cousin. Truly. I swore to aid your fight on the dragon, but...
Well, y-you'll fare better without me, no doubt! I would only be in the way of one so powerful as you!
Ho, I trust you paid that old lizard back for his work on our pier!? And then some, eh? Haw haw!
Here I supposed none had the balls to face the great wyrm.
Flee or be slain, I thought. Those seemed our only options.
My wife would crack me with the cookpot if she heard I harbored thoughts of flight. 
Trusted you to the end, my wife did. She found her faith that you would win the day.
I guess even the old girl can be right once in a while, eh? Haw haw!
Heading beyond the rift? And so soon after dispatchin' the dragon...
Quite the storybook your journey has become, eh cousin?
Well, carry on then. And any what gives you trouble, treat 'em to a swift kick in the balls for ol' Merin now, you hear?
You needn't fret over me, cos. I'm well enough.
Mm, thanks.
Summoned pawns do not gain levels,<cf>you know.
Instead of experience, they earn Rift<cf>Crystals for whomever created them.
When a summoned pawn's covenant<cf>ends, and they leave the party...
They return to their creator with all<cf>the equipment and items they carry.
And bear in mind, equipment gifted to<cf>summoned pawns cannot be reclaimed.
If no suitable pawns are at hand,<cf>simply access the rift pedestal.
Through it, pawns can be sought out<cf>and summoned.
Should one catch your eye, speak with<cf>the pawn to enlist it to your party.
'Tis the role of all pawns to serve<cf>the Arisen.
You may hire only two pawns on to your<cf>party at any one time. They can then be<cf>discharged by speaking with them again.
Pawn allies can then be discharged<cf>by speaking with them again.
Shall I carry back some message,<cf>Master?
Then I shall be going, Arisen.
If you've use for me again, you have<cf>but to say the word.
I see...
Till next we meet.
Understood.
Leave, afore I pluck out your eyes.
You aren't welcome here, outsider.
Mayhaps I'll do you a favor, and end your miserable life.
I've a blade with your name on it...shall I add your blood?
Haven't you got better things to do than bother me?
Watch your step, outsider.
Hrn?
Bother me again, I'll cut out your tongue.
So when will you be joining us?
Getting along well, then?
What d'you think you're doing!?
Bugger off!
Think y'er a big shot, do ya?
Shove off, friend.
Think you can just stroll around like the duke himself?
Keep pestering me and I'll answer you with my fist!
What are you waiting for!?
You're an odd one...
You really haven't anything better to do?
Still here, are you?
How do you fare?
Hoy!
Unforgivable!
This is a cruel jape indeed...
...For true?
We should've finished them when we had the chance...
This time, we won' be so forgiving.
Aye, aye...
What?
Ohh...
What next?
What, d'you need something?
I'm trying to work here. Move along.
What was that voice?
Arisen... Did you hear that, too?
Strange thing, that voice... It seemed to<cf>echo from within my head.
Was that voice the echo of some soul lost<cf>to this place?
We may encounter such voices elsewhere in<cf>this maze.
Quite a party you've inspired, Arisen.
One can only imagine how much this gathering costs...
Certainly the cost of this meal would support the men on the front for a week.
I do hope you'll be as successful at calling attention to the deeds of others as of your own.
If you'll excuse me.
Madeleine's shop? Sure, everyone knows of it.
She bought the place when the first owner fled the dragon -- opened for business soon after.
She has a fine head for figures... Bit stingy with the credit, if I dare say so.
It's odd she closed so sudden-like. I'd wager there's more to this tale than we can say.

Mad! Salvation is mad to conjure up such monsters!
They'll be eaten, sure as the rest of us!
Forgive me, ser, but I'll not open this door. I'll not be food for those beasts!
Then it's slain... Amazing. Ser, you are amazing.
I thought the Arisen little more than the stuff of old tales... How wrong I was!
Nh? The door...? The door! Of course, ser! I shall open it straight away!
Valmiro... Forgive me, ser -- I've yet to meet all the people of this village.
Though...one moment. I did see a young fisherman not unlike you describe, near the shore.
Seemed a kind enough lad, if a bit...unawares? As if his mind was elsewhere.
Stand firm! Attack!
The noblest of convictions can't fill a man's belly as well as the basest coin, aye?
Hmph. Not near as much fun as I'd hoped.
<R_G>Do as you're told, and a bit of coin will buy your freedom.
Bribe him (<NOTE>5000</NOTE>G)
Forget it
Mayhap I'm serving out my own sentence from some dread crime done in a past life.
I've no love of crowds, and less still of unwanted chatter. Pray, move along, ser.
You'll not escape!
What? Who the hell are you?
Piss off!
Am I supposed to care about your fancy title?
You're not wanted here, get it?
You're about to find out what we do to tresspassers firsthand.
I was just thinking about dealing someone bodily harm. Shall I start with you?
Bugger off!
You're as brazen a fool as any I've seen.
Don't you ever leave?
No one's killed you yet?
How goes it?
Hey!
Those pig-swiving, pox-stricken strumpets!
What're we to do about it?
Oho?
It's well past time to collect on these debts.
Now, what is the best way to make them bleed?
There's an idea!
Eh?
Ahh...exactly.
Then what?

I'm long recovered, cos. A seaman's nothing if not stout, aye?
He's not much without the waves beneath him, either.
I miss it dearly, but the shore is dangerous yet, I fear...
Seems an age since I had a rod and reel in hand.
Even were it possible again... In my state, I just don't know.
You're up and about already!?
I gave us all up for dead the moment the wyrm alit upon the beach.
It's a damned miracle so much of the village survived.
It's thanks to you, no doubt. Everyone's saying so.
Now we're left waiting for the folk who fled to the woods to come back...
I've been searching the woods, but still no sign of the ones who ran...
Seems fear carried them farther than I'd warranted. Not that I blame them, mind.
How long until all this calms down, d'you suppose?
Seems an age since I had a rod and reel in hand.
What is it, Arisen? How do I appear to you?
You are close, now... So very close to me!
Come, Arisen.
I shall meet you on your own terms,<cf>joined by my own companion of old.
You have chosen your path, and walked it true.
You stand now at its end, Arisen. See your journey through!
Let's deliver Ser Daerio's message.
Shall we pass on Ser Daerio's message?
We must speak with Lord Julien, or a<cf>castle guard, else.
Lord Julien will want to hear Ser Daerio's<cf>request.
Let's find Lord Julien and deliver this<cf>message.
Let's bring word to Lord Julien in Gran<cf>Soren.
Need we not give word to Lord Julien?
Are you certain that was the correct<cf>request...?
We've passed on Ser Daerio's request to<cf>the letter.
I fear the message suffered in transit...
Tis odd...I sense some other meaning in<cf>Lord Julien's words.
Let's return to the Stone of the North.
Tis good fortune we prevented a crisis ere<cf>it arose.
Then we were mistaken...
I cannot help but feel there was more to<cf>what Lord Julien said...
Ser Daerio's words were "one week's<cf>supply."
The message is delivered, just as we<cf>received it. Now to tell Ser Daerio.
Ser Daerio will be awaiting word, and<cf>we have Lord Julien's gift, besides.
Did we mistake his message, Arisen?
Ah.
Aanh...
Eaaaugh...
Nh!
Hnngh!
You are well, I hope?
May the Maker keep you.
Yes.
Heavens, no.
I thank you, ser.
I am unworthy of such kindness.
Greetings, traveler. Whence are you come?
I myself am here from an abbey well to the west.
I'd heard tell of the beasts that prowl the roads, but to see them myself... What a fright!
If you mean to walk those roads yourself, take care, good traveler.
May the Maker ever be your shield.
We had a visitor quite eager to ask about the Faith's scholarship on the dragon.
If one truly wished to learn of the dragon, they would need travel to the Grand Cathedral in Auldring.
Though, even among the sisters of the abbey, only the Mother Superior has ever been there.
Its doors do not easily open to outsiders, it seems.
If her motives for seeking knowledge of the wyrm are pure, the Maker will provide.
I know not how or when, but it will happen, sure as each new day dawns.
Many friends remain at the abbey I left, in the west.
It will take more than a dragon to scare them off, or me from this place!
I had not known that you and Quina both hail from the same village.
When I spoke to her of life at the abbey, she was quite eager to join.
I also learned she has a gift for healing.
The Maker works through each of us in different ways.
Perhaps if Quina cultivated her talents, the others in the abbey would take notice.
Perhaps their recommendations could even earn her entrance to the Grand Cathedral.
It seems only right her diligence be rewarded. I shall keep her in my prayers.
Talk is, things have taken a disturbing turn of late.
I hope no ill has befallen the abbey...
May the Maker watch over them, as you and I!
Pray, forgive me, traveler. I had not known you till but recently.
You are the one who slew the dragon, are you not?
I know not what's happening now, nor what's to come...
But my prayers go with you.
May you know peace amid the dark, and may the Maker ever guide you true.
I am unworthy of such kindness.

...Hmm?
I've got no time for chatter, friend.
Begone. 
I care not if you are the Arisen; I've no time for idle talk.
Ambition sees to the end of many a good man, but it shall not be so with me.
My name will be known throughout Gransys, or death take me.
What does it take for you to leave a man in peace!?
...
Enough. I know what you would say.
Guards or no guards...if the dragon comes, we're all of us undone.
I suppose you take pleasure in knowing that the world cries out to you for rescue?
I'd understand if pride was your watchword. The guard is but field mice in the face of that dragon.
Perhaps it's better I shed all reason and celebrate our impending doom, like the lunatics from Salvation?
Ah, by the Maker... I'll find no easy answers here.
I can only hope to wake tomorrow and find I still draw breath.
Days spent between fear and boredom. Nights spent forgotten in my cups. At least I keep my duty on watch, and proudly so.
I was prepared for my life to end in the flames of the wyrm. But now...
What fresh nightmare has befallen this city? Maker defend us.
'Tis a warm and sickly breeze...
Seems we can jump down and continue.
The dark grows more oppressive beyond.
Well, let's be done with it.
It will take better than that.
Clever, for a bird.
What!?
I do love a challenge.
Not bad.
Hah!
You'll regret that.
That was close...
Where are you this time...?
Waugh!
That hurt, you overfed buzzard!
I'm there!
No...!
Gaaaugh!
I was...careless...
I'll not be mocked by the likes of some animal!
We'll go to hell together, beast!
There's no place for you here, monster!
I'll do it. You lot stand aside!
You've gone and made a debtor of me.
Through here and up the tower stair! Quickly!
War comes ever at a cost. Tears can only rust a man's blade.
Every man's story ends in death.
Glorious or vain, it matters not once you're gone.

Well met, good Arisen.
'Tis a heartening boon to have your assistance in our endeavors.
I will not keep you long, for the survey party has already set out from Gran Soren.
They walk south, to the ruins at the falls -- near the encampment.
I know not what dangers await there, but I will rest easily knowing you accompany them.
Pray, fly now to their side, and keep watch over them. Maker speed your steps, ser.
The survey party set out for the falls by the encampment.
Pray, go and keep them safe, ser.
'Tis the role of the Faith to serve as an anchor for men's hearts in times of trouble.
To do so, we must be calm in the face of trials, swift and efficient in our actions.
That is why, above all else, we must have knowledge.
To allow custom or emotion to bar us from the chance to acquire new learning would be a grave sin.
And so, in the unyielding pursuit of wisdom, we must accept there will be casualties...
Our descent was slow work, and hard won... In the end, it claimed my master's life.
This place is home to fearsome creatures, ser. Take care...
'Tis a chilling sight...
Watching the cadavers fall ever down the shaft... It sets this pawn's body to trembling.
Have you aspirations, ser?
I never learned the meaning that word holds, and now...
I'd a task I wished to entrust to you, ser...
But Ser Mercedes insisted it be hers instead. She was most adamant.
Though she is a knight come in good faith to aid us, she remains daughter to Hearthstone's lord...
It does my heart no ease to see her undertake such a dangerous errand.
Alas, in the face of her ardent petition, there was naught I could do but accede.
Can I ask that you at least accompany her, ser? She must be kept safe.
Accept
Not now
My thanks, Arisen. Pray, go and speak to Ser Mercedes.
I see... Was I wrong to allow her? I fear 'tis late now for regrets...
I suspect Ser Mercedes has reason to insist on this matter so. Still...
I ask you, Arisen. Please go and speak with her. Lend her your aid.
Accept
Not now
Then Ser Mercedes has set out for the Stone of the North...
She marches with an escort, but these are perilous times, ser. Pray, lend her your hand.
It began with tell of unrest among the men of the northern hold. Lord Julien set out to investigate the matter.
The captain of the watch there is a fellow called Daerio. A good man, and true.
I cannot think him the sort to flee his post, nor to foment discord...
I've no inkling of what's become of the hold. The only way to know is to send eyes there directly.
It seems the Stone of the North stands quiet once again. You have my thanks.
'Twas an ill surprise indeed to find Salvation's reach extends so deep within our ranks.
'Tis a testament to the rising fear within the people's hearts.
We must be vigilant against such corruption, lest the duchy rot away afore the dragon ever comes.
I cannot believe Lord Julien's involvement in the troubles to the north!
'Tis a shock and an affront, and if he acted on orders from Meloire, 'tis the stuff of war!
...But our cruelest tortures will not like pry that confession from his lips.
We've no claim to anything more than his head.
Like as not, those who sent him knew as much. He was their knowing sacrifice.
The well by the gate, eh? Been years since that's seen use.
I've fond memories of exploring its caves as a child, though.
The chief was furious each time, near as much as my father was. Hah...
'Tis locked. You haven't the key to fit it...
'Tis caught on something. Perhaps it could open from the far side.
'Tis barred shut. Might be able to break the bolt.
'Tis shut tight.
'Tis no use at this hour. You'll have to come again later.
Best stop for now.
Seems they're closed.
Someone was here...
Lost them...
Gone...
Perhaps you've upset them.
There's naught to do here.
Best you moved on.
Not here...
The door is closed.
Shows no sign of opening.
There's aught there...
You don't see anything.
That smell...
Someone's near...
What's this...?
Fine view from here.
There's aught written here...
Must be a way to find something...
Smells delicious.
Perfect spot to place something.
You can almost reach...
There appears to be aught ahead.
That fall could kill.
'Tis dangerous to touch.
A strong blow might break it.
Perhaps if you came by night.
Perhaps if you came by day.
Perhaps if you came at dawn.
Perhaps if you came at dusk.
There's aught buried here...
You see no way up.
'Tis slick, this spot.
No use pressing any further.
No need to double back further.
No time for that now.
You cannot carry any more.
There may yet be aught lying about.
Seems there's naught you can take on at present.<cf>Best to try again later.
Perhaps with a bit of help...
Best you kept your weapon sheathed.
Is someone here...?
'Tis a place for tall folk.
'Tis a place for small folk.
Had you a woman in your band...
Had you a man in your band...
Had you a strong companion...
Had you a swift companion...
Had you a magick user...
Had you an apt climber...
Had you a skilled jumper...
This weapon will not help you.
That armor won't protect you.
You're ill equipped for this.
Seems it can't be used now.
You'll get no further use from it.
'Tis useless, now.
Hmm, not with your current equipment...
Not with your current party...
You hear aught from further in.
Enemies... They're close.
Best you got some rest.
You can carry no more!
You're too exhausted!
"Danger! Keep Out!"
"No Trespassing"
A sign.
Had you an Empty Flask, you might fill it here.
You'll get no further without a lantern.
'Tis dangerous to fumble about in the dark. Best find a light.
Best not just leave them.
If aught were left here, it would rot.
Best take care you don't get lost.
Best check the map.
You're due for a rest.
This place is dangerous by night.
This place is dangerous by day.
Breathtaking...
You'll get no further!
Seems you'll need to come back.
Nothing left here.
It looks fit to crumble.
Seems it could be moved...
It will not budge.
It will not open.
Seems you need a key.
Seems you need a Pickaxe here.
You yet lack the experience.
You yet lack the skill.
Not with your current vocation...
You'll not pass through this gate.
You've no time!
Seems you were too late.
You may make it, yet.
You're doing well for time.
Seems you've come at the wrong time.
There may be another path.
You'll not get through without a key.
You can hear the guards outside. Best you took another route.
'Tis poor footing, and the river below... Best you carried her.
The bridge is fallen. You'll get no further.
No matter how you fiddle with it, 'tis still broken.
Aelinore is gone! No doubt she's been spirited away.
You mustn't leave Aelinore behind!
The lock opens.
Performing actions that people dislike will<cf>decrease their affinity for you.
A Ferrystone will spirit you back to Gran<cf>Soren in an instant, no matter where you<cf>are located.
It is by far the fastest and safest method<cf>of travel, but each stone disappears after<cf>a single use.
You can equip yourself with a primary and<cf>a secondary weapon.
Primary weapons such as swords and daggers<cf>are combat essentials. Secondary weapons<cf>like bows and shields offer support.
In addition to weapons and armor, you can<cf>also equip accoutrements with certain special<cf>abilities to give you an edge in battle.
Only one piece of jewelry and a single<cf>cloak can be equipped as accoutrements<cf>at any one time.
A heavy load will cause your Stamina to<cf>deplete more quickly. Sell or discard<cf>any and all items you no longer need.
Your lantern consumes oil. If it dims,<cf>use a Flask of Oil to refill it.
Some items can be combined with others to<cf>produce surprising results. Experiment and<cf>see what you come up with. 
Place waypoint markers on your map to<cf>keep track of your progress.
If you've forgotten where you are in the story,<cf>select "Chronicle" from the Pause Menu to<cf>review a history of your journey thus far.
Select "Options" from the Pause Menu to<cf>customize your mini-map and status display.
The higher the fall, the more damage you<cf>will suffer.
Note that you move somewhat slower while<cf>your weapon is drawn.
Exhausting all Stamina will make you unable<cf>to act for a time. Take care to conserve<cf>energy!
You can attack while clinging to foes.
Petrifaction cannot be cured by normal<cf>magick, and is fatal if left untreated.
Use Secret Softener or the like to<cf>cure any petrified allies.
Your rank within a vocation rises as you<cf>defeat foes and complete quests. At higher<cf>ranks, a broader variety of skills are available.
Defeating foes and completing quests earns<cf>you more discipline, boosting your prowess<cf>in a vocation.
Pawns will collect and use items of their<cf>own volition.
You cannot carry or purchase items that<cf>would cause you to exceed your maximum<cf>encumbrance.
Press <TUTO><SIZE 25><ICON TOUCH></SIZE> while climbing down a ladder<cf>to descend quickly. 
If a pawn remains unconscious for too long,<cf>they will be forfeit.
Your support pawn has become forfeit, and<cf>returned to the realm whence they came.
Your main pawn has become forfeit,<cf>disappearing and returning to the rift.
You cannot join covenants with other pawns<cf>while your main pawn is forfeit.
Touch any riftstone to return your lost<cf>main pawn to your side.
If a support pawn is forfeit, any items<cf>they were carrying are sent to item storage.
You can send off departing pawns with a<cf>single item as a gift for their creator.
You can pass items to and from your pawns<cf>on the sub menu.
Pray, speak with our captain, ser. He'll wish to discuss our stratagem.
This hole is goblin-dug, ser, and seems to lead inside. Pray, take care.
Victory! Victory is ours!
Aye, the grimoire is here with me.
Sadly, I've no mind to give it up, nor do I have want of your coin.
Now, if there were aught I wanted, and gold had failed... I would next try steel.
Well...? Have you the mettle, ser?
Aye, the grimoire is here with me. It came to me by chance.
You know a man who seeks it? And well you might. 'Tis quite the treasure.
Salomet knew no peer as a scholar. The man is well renown.
If you desire the book, I'll not deny you.
'Tis a fair price to pay that I might count the Arisen in my debt.<cf>...Here. Take it.
Remember this: We are not friends, you and I. Only tools to be exploited.
Mngh!
Grhh!
Gaahh...
Ha!
Yahh!
Hello.
Maker speed your steps.
Mm-hmm.
Mmm...no.
Mm, thank you.
Ah! You are a saintly one.
The situation is well and truly deadlocked.
If we're overrun, they'll make for human settlements.
I'd give all for more men to engage the beasts in a proper hunt...
It's enough to vex a man till he's wrinkled and gray, I assure you.
Ach, it seems half a lifetime ago, now.
Hail, Arisen! I trust this day finds you well.
Outpost defense is not like to bring a man glory, but it's yet a key duty of the Guard.
Though our isolated station here means we seldom hear from command.
We would trust in you, Arisen, to serve as our eyes and ears in any matters of import.
Word has spread even here, Arisen. We hear the capital is in a wretched way.
I'll not abandon my post without leave...
But I must confess: I've been driven near to madness with worry on our fair capital...
Mm, thank you.
Arisen. Ser, I am in dire straits.
'Tis a matter concerning my daughter.
Hear him out
Not now
I thank you, ser. I'd not know what to do without your help.
I leave shortly for a meeting of merchants, fit to take a full day. I cannot but attend.
Of all the luck, it falls upon the day I promised my Symone I'd take her through the city.
I would ask that you escort her in my stead, ser.
You can see her there... I'll not lie to you. She is a spitfire like to rival the wyrm.
But I will reward you. Handsomely. ...You will do it, won't you?
I fear I must leave presently. Pray, ask her directly if you've any further questions. My thanks, ser!
What? Truly, ser, do you not think such callousness undue?
We are closer friends than that, no? Surely close enough to lend an ear to the other in times of trouble.
Please, Arisen -- pay me the mercy to listen to my request, at the least...
I've desperate need of you with a matter regarding my daughter.
Hear him out
Not now
My thanks, ser, and well done. I knew you were the one to ask!
My daughter sang your praises. It seems the Arisen commands the hearts of more than just pawns.
I shall come to you directly the next time I've a need.
Ah, good. You've returned. What kept you out so long?
I should think you traversed all Gran Soren thrice by now. I'd begun to worry!
It seems your talents lie on the field of battle, ser.
Ah, 'tis you, Arisen. ...My daughter seems to have taken to you, ser.
Will you take her around the capital again?
Text upon a tablet? And found amid the dangers of the wood, no less... Your bravery is a wonder, ser.
I dearly wish I could tell you its meaning, but I fear I am yet early in my studies as a priest...
Sad to say all I can tell you for certain is that the text resembles Wyrmspeak.
Have you perchance been north past the capital to the place they call Hillfigure Knoll?
I have heard rumor of a man there able to speak the language of dragons. True or no, 'tis a start...
Pray, have you been north past the capital, to Hillfigure Knoll?
If rumors hold true, you may learn aught there of the language of dragons writ upon that slate.
Uh...
Ungh.
Waaaugh...
Hn!
Hnnh!
Some need of me...?
Goodbye...
Yes...
No...
Thank you...
I am...very glad. Thank you...
This...for me!?
'Tis a marvel... I am wondrous glad of it.
I feel as if I am just born, newly alive at last this moment!
...
Why...?
The mists... They keep most out...
But you... Why...?
The ward... It is diminished? Else...
You... You have need of me...again?
Gran spoke of this...
Said not to speak with you...<cf>With people from beyond the wood...
Others rarely come... When they do, they... They frighten me...
I hid away.
Why is it, now...?
Why do you...not frighten me?
You... You have need of me...again?
We meet again...
I've been here, alone... Since Gran died...
I've stayed and thought... About my journey with Gran...
Why is it that...I remember it so clearly when you are near?
'Tis strange... I am not now as I was then... As I was when I was with Gran...
Somehow, I am changed...
Gran spoke of this...
Said not to speak with you...<cf>With people from beyond the wood...
I... I've become human... Have I not?
Human... Like you.
No more do I follow another as I did Gran... As a pawn does her master.
Now, I can live together with you as a fellow man... An equal.
In truth, I would gladly leave here now to go anywhere with you...
But I would be naught but a burden if I joined you now.
After what has happened here, I... Perhaps I had best not be seen awhile.
Do not worry for me.
I have ever lived hidden away from others.
Once all has grown calm...will you come and see me again?
You've come again... I am glad.
I've come to understand... You are like my Gran.
I loved her...
Just before she died, my Gran told me to live out my life...
And so I am, I think, because of her...
Gran told me to live, but...
I feel I do not truly know what it means, to live.
But I do know that... That being here now, with you, makes me -- glad...
I feel I do not truly know what it means, to live.
But I do know that... That being here now, with you, makes me -- glad...
You... You have need of me...again?
Herbs for alemaking...?
Here...
More herbs, for ale...?
Here you are...
Yes, I know... Herbs for ale, yes...?
You are welcome to these...
I... I feel I...know you.
There, in the dragon's keeping, I was frightened... Truly frightened.
Scared to die... After meeting you, I was scared to lose it all...
'Twas the first time I had ever been truly conscious of death.
'Til now it had ever held little meaning for me as a pawn.
But it is that mortality that gives human life its color. Life without death is no life, in truth.
I've come to understand that now, as a human myself.
Invalid Message
The hold is fallen, stones scattered like so many pebbles...
The dragon's strength is not of this world. Man can have no hope of defeating it.
If you would give chase even so, the path to the Tainted Mountain now lies open...
Will you go, Arisen?
No time for chatter; I have orders to await my next orders.
Ah...
Eek!
Aaaaah...
Ha.
Yaah!
Hail there.
Fare well.
Yes.
No...
Thank you.
How wonderful! Thank you, ser.
Why not stay a spell?
You've a good eye.
I fear it will take more than that.
Hmm, what d'you say to this?
Right, then.
Safe and sound, eh?
All right, then.
I simply can't, ser.
I hear tell you're the Arisen. That true? I must say, I like the look of you.
Make a habit of coming by, ser, and I shall take good care of you.
Why not stay a spell?
Far be it from me to speak ill of anyone, but were I you, I'd not trust the rubbish they're selling elsewhere.
I've a proper license from the duke to keep shop here, I do.<cf>My wares come with my warranty.
Why not stay a spell?
Take care dealing with traveling merchants.
Their kind will sing a pretty tune about some rare trinket and have you empty your purse for a trifle.
Worse still if it's ensorceled goods you're buying. I say again, take care.
Why not stay a spell?
You've made quite the impression to be under direct employ of the duke.
You'll be wanting to fill all manner of new needs now, aye? Come by any time, love.
Why not stay a spell?
D'you know a fellow by the name of Reynard, by chance?
He came by not long ago plying all manner of treasure maps and grimoires, each more suspect than the last.
I trust his kind only so far as I can throw them.
Had I your muscle, I'd do just that. Take care with that one, love.
Why not stay a spell?
There's an awful din at the castle of late. Terrible for business...
I know it's not proper to say, but if there's to be warring, I wish they'd do it out in the field somewhere.
Should swords cross, I've no desire to be caught in the middle.
There's an awful din at the castle of late. Terrible for business...
Maker's breath... The ground's a gaping dark, and not two steps away.
I s'pose I should be thankful for my life. Long as I'm alive, I can do business...
You keep steady on, too, love.
There's naught to do but live so long as you're alive, earthquakes and dragonfire be damned.
Thank you.

Do come again.
Thank you for the custom.
Do come again.
Do come again.
I am he who winds the shroud.
I bear no grudge against you, Arisen, but you shall die by my hand just the same.
Shall I dispatch you in haste? Or would you draw out your death to prolong the agony?
Strike now.
I am in no hurry.
A shame. But no matter.
Close your eyes, Arisen, so your end might arrive all the sooner. 
Ah, well chosen, ser. Just as life, death should be savored...
Only the Nameless Men know when the final curtain shall fall. I leave you to consider the truth of this. Until we meet again...
I am he who walks the broken road.
I bear no grudge against you, Arisen, but you shall die by my hand just the same.
I take it you've heard? Then you'll know that this task is mine.
I'll not be an idle burden on the duke's hospitality any longer.
And surely you've won enough glory, ser. Allow me this one chance to prove myself.
Yes
No
You have my thanks.
This matter concerns Lord Julien as well.
There is talk of dark happenings at the Stone of the North -- Lord Julien's watch.
He set out for the hold himself some time ago, but there has been no word since.
Someone must go and see what is become of him. As a fellow guest of the duke's, I felt it my duty.
I would forbid you from interceding, but you no doubt have your own reasons for going.
I will not stop you from joining me, but neither can I wait. Follow if you wish, ser. I am off.
You cannot stay me in this matter, ser. I will not be thought an idle ornament any longer.
Besides, this matter concerns Lord Julien as well.
There is talk of dark happenings at the Stone of the North -- Lord Julien's watch.
He set out for the hold himself some time ago, but there has been no word since.
As a fellow guest come to Gransys' aid, I cannot simply leave him to his fate.
I would insist on going alone, but you no doubt have your own reasons for going.
I will not stop you from joining me, but neither can I wait. Follow if you wish, ser. I am off.
I had thought...nay, trusted you were above the base treasons of Salvation's like!
The Night's Champion!? Bah! An oathbreaker of your ilk is champion to no man, Julien!
And what of those of this land who will die for your peace!?
Will you stand idly by while a people lose their land, their very lives to a plague of beasts!?
You are no knight, villain!
How dare you, ser!? I will not suffer such slander!
Rrgh...! Bastard!
Ngh...
I must make a pitiable sight...
I knew... I am a meager choice to send as aid. I know it well!
Still, I... I could not...
I fear I put on a shameful display...
Lord Julien had the truth of it, every word... I am weak.
I serve no purpose here, save as hollow homage to an empty pact. Aid in name only...
Hearthstone or Gransys, there's not a man in either who expected anything else of me.
I knew it well enough. Tasted it on every breath I drew... Yet still I fancied myself a knight.
Arisen...
I will return to Hearthstone.
Not to lick my wounds, but to petition my lord father that Gransys' people receive true aid.
I will not send you to meet the dragon with their fates weighing upon you.
After, I shall return here. To aid you however I may.
I am a fool.
Pray, accept this token. I haven't much to give, but...
It would please me to know it provided you some small comfort on your journey.
'Tis ill a match for the ring you gave to me, I know. More's the pity...
I cannot hope to grow strong overnight, but I will return a woman able to serve you.
Until then, pray, be well...
...For me, ser?
Better suited to rings than rapiers, am I? Let a woman useless as a knight serve as a wife?
Is this your meaning?
...'Tis a jest, ser. I would be joyed to wear it, as a remembrance of a dear friend.
Ah, hello... As you can like tell from the look of me, I'm at my wit's end.
I've need to travel south through this mine, but the accursed gate won't budge.
Despite the dangers, I came this way hoping to shorten my journey... Some shortcut, eh?
'Tis a fine waste of time if the gate cannot be lowered.
Offer to open the gate
Ignore him
I've found a shortcut to nowhere at all, I have... Brilliant work, Alon...
If only some able hero might activate the mechanism what keeps the gate shut...
Offer to open the gate
Ignore him
D'you mean that? You'll see it opened? Aye, 'twould be a most welcome boon!
But are you so certain you can make it so? You do seem a strong enough sort, I'll warrant...
What's that? ...Already opened? My, but you work fast.
Then I'll be safely on my way. My thanks for... Eh? Still rife with monsters, is it?
Then the likes of me best not go strutting through just yet, eh?
You've the look of quite the champion, ser. Fancy whetting your steel on a few of those beasts?
What's that? ...All clear, you say? Happy news, that! You are a wonder, ser.
I'll not tarry about, then.
With this route open, the merchants of the capital will have an easier time bringing in goods from afar.
'Tis a fine thing for sellers and buyers alike, having trade on the rise.
Hmm, I've tried all I can. Naught to do now but pray some kind stranger chances along...
Bested the gate, have you? Happy news, that! I'll just be on my way, then.
Eh? Still rife with monsters, is it? Well that won't do at all...
Say, you've half cleared the path already, ser. Fancy finishing the job for a fellow?
I've every confidence you'll prevail, I do. Off you go, then!
Well, friend? What news? I will admit, 'tis a small comfort to see a seasoned traveler vexed as I was.
'Tis a jest, friend. I know it for a brazen request, and dangerous what's more. Still, my livelihood hangs in the balance...
I must have the gate opened, and you're as like to succeed as any. I wish you good luck.
All clear, you say? Happy news, that! You are a wonder, ser.
I'll not tarry about, then.
With this route open, the merchants of the capital will have an easier time bringing in goods from afar.
'Tis a fine thing for sellers and buyers alike, having trade on the rise.
In truth, I would not have chosen this route had I known it so vexed...
Seems monsters spring up faster than toadstools in such places, eh?
'Tis like to be dangerous, I know, but I've faith in your abilities, ser. Take care.

(Arisen!)
(Stand against me!)
(Show me your strength!)
(Does doubt haunt you?)
(Such power...)
(Aye, that is the way, chosen one.)
(I am your master.)
(Am I to die...?)
(The seat of god lies beyond...)
(You are not the vessel.)
(Are you at an end, little one?)
Unchecked, the beast will put the capital to ruin! Hundreds could die!
Ser Aldous awaits you, Arisen.
Best you did not keep him waiting.
Arisen! You've come... I fear our defeat is plain<cf>to see.
We thought to inundate the wyrm with sheer<cf>numbers. A sea of blades... 'Twas a fool's hope.
Our sea runs dry, and the duke's army is lost in<cf>the gambit.
Arisen... I beg you, ser. Grant vengeance to those<cf>who've fallen.
If this be of use, I would give it gladly.
Waste no time on me, ser. Go!
Well Madeleine, this is a fine bit of fortune you've come into...
Come to Gran Soren with riches in mind...instead find only cravens, cowed by dragon-fear.
The streets are chaos, my goods ruined or lost...
Oh, I know you. You took up steel and drove the dragon from Cassardis, yes? I heard about that.
And of course you know me. I come here now and again to restock my wares.
Er, you do recall me, yes? Madeleine? ...Finest peddler in all Gransys?
Ravishing beauty of legend and song? ...Madeleine?
Well, no matter. I've bigger problems.
These are dark days, so terrible as to drive even I to the brink of tears.
And yet, just when I need the aid of one both clever and strong...you arrive.
Truly, fortune means us to partner together! Don't you agree?
Indeed.
I think not.
Only a fool could mistake the thread of destiny what links us.
You will be my savior true, and after me, the world entire!
And with that, we must be off.
I trust you know of the encampment outside the village?
I must travel there with all speed, but the wilds are perilous of late.
Would you see me there safely?
Oh fie! The spark between us cannot be denied. Even one so thick as you must ken it!
You, the mighty warrior what saved this village from the dragon's wrath! It's only natural you would aid me next.
Do you now see that the fates brought us together?
And what a chance it is, to protect so fair a maiden in her hour of need!
Accept
Refuse
I yet cannot fathom how you drove that terrible wyrm from the village...
That dragon has ill timing for true. I was near to closing several deals in Gran Soren when it struck.
You should pursue a future yourself in the capital, you know. One who can face down a dragon would find no shortage of clients.
Tis a shame monsters forced the mountain pass what leads there closed... We have the dragon to thank for that as well!
I make for the encampment to speak with the guard captain, and learn when they will reopen the pass.
True, there are other ways to the capital. Other paths...
But enough idle chatter. We should move.
Aha, gold!
Now there's a fine treat!
Eyaah!
No, no, no -- help!
Yes, he's all yours!
Whew... I grow weary...
I'd typically not lower my guard in the wild, but as you're by my side, it seems a fair time for rest.
Hold a moment. There's aught here...
Success! And all thanks goes to your fine work.
We'd best be inside, don't you think?
This may sound untoward, but...
Have you aught in the way of coin?
Please! I must make for the capital, but times are dark, and my purse light.
It's a terrible curse, being poor. Times are it takes all I have just to keep the tears back.
<R_G>Will you spare some gold? I would repay you, of course...at some point. ...Most likely.
Offset her travel expenses (<NOTE>1000</NOTE>G)
Refuse
I am so very much in love with you at this moment.
A woman's heart is a dangerous creature, but you know well how to tame it.
Oft has it been said a poor life is a happy one. I have never found this to be true.
If ever fortune sees you to Gran Soren and me to setting up my shop, you must come visit. I shall even give you a discount! ...A small one. 
Fie! Is there no room in your black heart for mercy?
I fear for any who would call you lover, if you're this cruel to one so fair and kind as I.
Ah, well. I see your mind is set.
If ever fortune sees you to Gran Soren and me to setting up my shop, I would still ask you visit...but perhaps with a looser grip on your purse.
Wait! You would abandon me!?
You swore to be my shield!
Mm? Going back, are we?
Very well, then...
Just what is your aim, ser?
Let's be on our way.
Now! This is more like it.
Yaaah!
N-no...
Ah, how fare you, Arisen? Yet keeping the world safe from danger? Myself, I prepare for my shop to open...
Don't see the harm in offering a small preview. Suppose I owe you as much...
Tee hee! Oh, Maker take me! It's the Arisen!
Why so gloomy, ser? You should spend more time enjoying what good things this life offers.
Hm, you wish to shop? Well then, pray feast your eyes on my fine wares.
There -- look!
All's lost...
Aanh?
I've no use for you.
Keep your distance, filth.
You've no place here.
Scared, are ya?
Be off with ya.
Why are you here?
Don't get cocky, you.
To living easy, aye?
Hoy there. You look eager.
...Oh?
The...witch?
You seek...Grandmother?
She is...dead. She...died. As all must.
Gran told me...
The Faith...knows. It cloaks...the dragon. Cloaks...the truth.
Those who search for truth...outside the Faith...are branded heretic.
...Yes.
Might I... Might I know you? You seem...familiar...
Aldous joins the duke in urgent conference. I fear he shall not return for some time.
Pray, leave them to their business, Arisen.
You've no time to waste in the castle, besides. Speed south, ser!
It worked! It worked!
Rage! Tear the city stone from stone!
Salvation comes! Gran Soren will be dyed in blood and drown in fear!
You fools! You've allowed Salvation right through your gates!
Die, die! Die!
Aaaaaaugh!
E...lysion...!
'Tis locked. You haven't the key to fit it...
'Tis caught on something. Perhaps it could open from the far side.
'Tis barred shut. Might be able to break the bolt.
'Tis shut tight.
'Tis no use at this hour. You'll have to come again later.
Best stop for now.
Seems they're closed.
Someone was here...
Lost them...
Gone...
Perhaps you've upset them.
There's naught to do here.
Best you moved on.
Not here...
The door is closed.
Shows no sign of opening.
There's aught there...
You don't see anything.
That smell...
Someone's near...
What's this...?
Fine view from here.
There's aught written here...
Must be a way to find something...
Smells delicious.
Perfect spot to place something.
You can almost reach...
There appears to be aught ahead.
That fall could kill.
'Tis dangerous to touch.
A strong blow might break it.
Perhaps if you came by night.
Perhaps if you came by day.
Perhaps if you came at dawn.
Perhaps if you came at dusk.
There's aught buried here...
You see no way up.
'Tis slick, this spot.
No use pressing any further.
No need to double back further.
No time for that now.
You cannot carry any more.
There may yet be aught lying about.
Seems there's naught you can take on at present.<cf>Best to try again later.
Perhaps with a bit of help...
Best you kept your weapon sheathed.
Is someone here...?
'Tis a place for tall folk.
'Tis a place for small folk.
Had you a woman in your band...
Had you a man in your band...
Had you a strong companion...
Had you a swift companion...
Had you a magick user...
Had you an apt climber...
Had you a skilled jumper...
This weapon will not help you.
That armor won't protect you.
You're ill equipped for this.
Seems it can't be used now.
You'll get no further use from it.
'Tis useless, now.
Hmm, not with your current equipment...
Not with your current party...
You hear aught from further in.
Enemies... They're close.
Best you got some rest.
You can carry no more!
You're too exhausted!
"Danger! Keep Out!"
"No Trespassing"
A sign.
Had you an Empty Flask, you might fill it here.
You'll get no further without a lantern.
'Tis dangerous to fumble about in the dark. Best find a light.
Best not just leave them.
If aught were left here, it would rot.
Best take care you don't get lost.
Best check the map.
You're due for a rest.
This place is dangerous by night.
This place is dangerous by day.
Breathtaking...
You'll get no further!
Seems you'll need to come back.
Nothing left here.
It looks fit to crumble.
Seems it could be moved...
It will not budge.
It will not open.
Seems you need a key.
Seems you need a Pickaxe here.
You yet lack the experience.
You yet lack the skill.
Not with your current vocation...
You'll not pass through this gate.
You've no time!
Seems you were too late.
You may make it, yet.
You're doing well for time.
Seems you've come at the wrong time.
There may be another path.
'Tis a powerful weapon... Too bad it doesn't work.

Blades to temper, mail to mend...
Times of war mean ample business for a smithy.
The present struggle's a mite different than most, mind. Still, even dragons die!
A man can get a notion of the size of an army by the count of the arms they buy.
By that measure, the Duke's men are too few by an order.
There's talk of begging help from the neighboring lands, but who can say when they'll arrive?
I've no conception on the number of men required to fell a dragon...
But I doubt the men now counted in His Grace's employ are enough to hold even the castle.
What news from the castle? Any word of those allied forces' arrival?
As I hear it told, the only capable sword come from afar is Ser Julien.
A man of his talents may well be given command of the hold to the north.
Then there's that woman knight. Mercedes, was it?
I've heard men speak of her beauty. Less so her hand with a blade...
A smith worth his salt can read a man's skill from the state of his weapon.
Yours... Yours speaks well enough of you.
Some weeks back, I heard a band of men went 'round buying up an arsenal.
Word is, not one of them had the look of an honest soldier. There's the start of your revolt, right there.

Chamberlain Aldous awaits us within<cf>the castle.
Chamberlain Aldous will have our<cf>wages from the duke.
Let us leave none of the chamberlain's<cf>tasks undone!
Once our preparations are complete, we<cf>ought meet with Chamberlain Aldous.
"You have been chosen."
So saying, the wyrm prised the heart from my breast.
I was made Arisen: known to the dragon, and bound to hunt it.
It is a fate I embrace. What use have I for a heart<cf>left hollow?
In a world without sweet Grette--my mentor, my<cf>mother, my beloved...
I live only to see the dragon that claimed her slain.
I will see its scaly hide stripped from bone by my<cf>hands ere I rest.
Madeleine will be pleased.
Let's return to Madeleine.
I've heard talk of an idol lost in the Frontier Caverns.
Madeleine was well pleased. We'll reap rewards from<cf>this in times to come.
Despite her tepid response, that idol will be a boon<cf>to Madeleine's business.
First let's find where we're headed.<cf>I pray it's nowhere too distant...
Let's set about to finding this idol, then.
We're close, mark my words...
Perform a favor for Fournival and we<cf>may earn that golden idol.
Who do you suppose holds a golden idol?
Perhaps giving Madeleine a fine idol<cf>will earn us a discount.
We may earn a golden idol from its<cf>owner in return for a favor...
A silver idol is nearby.
We've already an idol, Master.<cf>Need we find them all?
Shall we look for more?
We need that figurine to win the<cf>smithy's trust.
Were it gold, she'd have been happier still.
This must be it!
Fournival holds a golden icon...<cf>Let's make for Gran Soren.
There is a hierarchy of icons.<cf>Best find the best we can.
There are those among the pawns that haunt this place who attack any they see.
I know not the cause of their corruption... Perhaps no one does.
I lost my master, and with him what pale shadow of emotion I possessed...
I cannot even grieve him now. I simply remain, hollow... Empty.
Were it not for that beast, my master would yet live...
But he is gone, while I remain...alone...

To the castle, men. Step lively!
State your business!
Who goes there!?
Where d'you think you're going?
Halt!
You'll go no farther!
M-my deepest apologies...
What brings you here, ser?
I cannot allow even the Arisen to pass unbidden.
I would thank you to refrain from such actions in the future, ser...

'Tis locked. You haven't the key to fit it...
'Tis caught on something. Perhaps it could open from the far side.
'Tis barred shut. Might be able to break the bolt.
'Tis shut tight.
'Tis no use at this hour. You'll have to come again later.
Best stop for now.
Seems they're closed.
Someone was here...
Lost them...
Gone...
Perhaps you've upset them.
There's naught to do here.
Best you moved on.
Not here...
The door is closed.
Shows no sign of opening.
There's aught there...
You don't see anything.
That smell...
Someone's near...
What's this...?
Fine view from here.
There's aught written here...
Must be a way to find something...
Smells delicious.
Perfect spot to place something.
You can almost reach...
There appears to be aught ahead.
That fall could kill.
'Tis dangerous to touch.
A strong blow might break it.
Perhaps if you came by night.
Perhaps if you came by day.
Perhaps if you came at dawn.
Perhaps if you came at dusk.
There's aught buried here...
You see no way up.
'Tis slick, this spot.
No use pressing any further.
No need to double back further.
No time for that now.
You cannot carry any more.
There may yet be aught lying about.
Seems there's naught you can take on at present.<cf>Best to try again later.
Perhaps with a bit of help...
Best you kept your weapon sheathed.
Is someone here...?
'Tis a place for tall folk.
'Tis a place for small folk.
Had you a woman in your band...
Had you a man in your band...
Had you a strong companion...
Had you a swift companion...
Had you a magick user...
Had you an apt climber...
Had you a skilled jumper...
This weapon will not help you.
That armor won't protect you.
You're ill equipped for this.
Seems it can't be used now.
You'll get no further use from it.
'Tis useless, now.
Hmm, not with your current equipment...
Not with your current party...
You hear aught from further in.
Enemies... They're close.
Best you got some rest.
You can carry no more!
You're too exhausted!
"Danger! Keep Out!"
"No Trespassing"
A sign.
Had you an Empty Flask, you might fill it here.
You'll get no further without a lantern.
'Tis dangerous to fumble about in the dark. Best find a light.
Best not just leave them.
If aught were left here, it would rot.
Best take care you don't get lost.
Best check the map.
You're due for a rest.
This place is dangerous by night.
This place is dangerous by day.
Breathtaking...
You'll get no further!
Seems you'll need to come back.
Nothing left here.
It looks fit to crumble.
Seems it could be moved...
It will not budge.
It will not open.
Seems you need a key.
Seems you need a Pickaxe here.
You yet lack the experience.
You yet lack the skill.
Not with your current vocation...
You'll not pass through this gate.
You've no time!
Seems you were too late.
You may make it, yet.
You're doing well for time.
Seems you've come at the wrong time.
There may be another path.
A sign's been posted.
They should open shortly.
Seems they're closed.
Sold out, it seems.
Seems your dealings here are done.
You've naught more to trade.
You've no coin.
You've naught left to sell.
Seems they've no more stock.
They've naught worth buying.
Fine selection.
The well's gone mostly dry. No signs of it being used of late.
Been living here since you were born, though you ne'er were one to stay indoors long.
Where could Quina have gone off to...
You've no cause to leave. Why not walk about the village a while longer?
The stable for the cart oxen. 
Food for the oxen.
You can see all Cassardis from here.
There's a fallen tower in the distance...
There's been no fishing since the dragon struck.
They look well dried. Makes you hungry just to look on them...
You see a chest, but...
That smoke smells well nice.
The bed's been left half a mess.
Food stores, piled away.
Vegetables hung to dry, or be pickled, most like.
Some healing herb, perhaps, or simple decoration, else.
Quina's bed. It has a nice sort of smell to it. Her smell.
'Tis like he still keeps dried food in there.
That flag is the chief's prized possession. A fisherman's charm.
A curious smell comes from that large urn.
Uncommon design, for the village.
An old monument or the like. You know not to what.
If you recall, one may boil these pink ones to make medicine.
A few notes, writ in Quina's hand. "Church," "dragon," "Witchwood"...
You ought get this freight to the boat.
It bears the names of those who fell when the dragon struck.
'Twas wrought by Merin and Elvar. The flowers look fresh.
Selene is gone... But to where?
Supplies for the village. You'd best leave them be.
Stores for the village. 'Tis shut tight...
Part of the village's stores. They need it more than you.
'Tis Pablos' stock. You'll not let some thief run off with it!
Heraldo's supplies. 'Tis your job to keep them safe.
This is Aestella's, and you'll not see it stolen.
Had you a bottle, you might take some of this with you.
'Tis more fragile than it looks. Best be gentle with it.
'Tis empty, now.
The notice board. 'Tis wise to keep an eye on it for work.
This sturdy chair would make a fine spot to mentor your main pawn, were they at hand...
As its said, best let sleeping dogs lie. Sleeping people, too.
You could attempt to strike up conversation...you just won't succeed.

Performing actions that people dislike will<cf>decrease their affinity for you.
A Ferrystone will spirit you back to Gran<cf>Soren in an instant, no matter where you<cf>are located.

If aught were left here, it would rot.
Best take care you don't get lost.

You're due for a rest.
This place is dangerous by night.
This place is dangerous by day.
Breathtaking...
You'll get no further!
Seems you'll need to come back.
Nothing left here.
It looks fit to crumble.
Seems it could be moved...
It will not budge.
It will not open.
Seems you need a key.
Seems you need a Pickaxe here.
You yet lack the experience.
You yet lack the skill.
Not with your current vocation...
You'll not pass through this gate.
You've no time!
Seems you were too late.
You may make it, yet.
You're doing well for time.
Seems you've come at the wrong time.
There may be another path.
'Tis a powerful weapon... Too bad it doesn't work.
'Tis an unlit beacon. Seems it requires<cf>rift crystals to light. Perhaps it could<cf>weaken foes in the area with its holy light.
Light the beacon?<cf>Current rift crystals: <RIMS><cf>Rift crystal cost: <RIM2>
You haven't enough rift crystals to light<cf>the beacon.

Make haste. This place drives even the<cf>stoutest of minds to lunacy.
I gave body and soul to this cause, and for<cf>what...? Damn the Arisen, like as the dragon!
I'll accompany you to the encampment, when<cf>you're ready.
Shall we to the encampment, Master?
The Brine roam the open sea.<cf>Best keep your distance.
Take care by the water's edge, lest<cf>the Brine take you.
Those crags may hide monsters.
We may find aught worth taking along.
Shan't be long now, Arisen.
Morning, afternoon, night -- each leg<cf>of the day bears its own discoveries.
Chests oft hold articles and<cf>treasures of great value.
You'll find ore, plants, and other<cf>materials at harvest points.
Danger lurks in the sea. Best not<cf>wade too deep lest you become bait.
Some ledges and obstacles can only<cf>be scaled first with a leap.
Falling from great heights can lead <cf>to injury...or death. Be cautious.
Pay heed to the markers that appear<cf>on the map or over the people you meet. 
When you take damage, use curative<cf>items to replenish your health.
Vanquishing foes earns you<cf>experience, discipline, and more.
Should the enemy prove too powerful,<cf>there is no shame in fleeing.
Tarry too long and your chance to<cf>complete a quest might disappear.
Resist idle exploration unless you<cf>have the time and energy to do so.
Captain Mercedes has already headed to the Stone.
Maker's breath... To think that he was behind the rebellion...
Then fear has bested you as well...
So be it. Go, and seek your peace. Your guttering beacon in the churning dark.
And I shall await the coming of the next...
Augh!
I heard report of an unfamiliar man seen within the castle's halls.
...They say he had the look of that sorcerer.
Ah.
Aanh...
Aaaaaugh...
Nh!
Eagh!
How does the day find you?
Pray, excuse me.
Yes.
No.
I thank you for your kindness.
Oh, joy! My thanks, ser!
Oh, joy! My thanks, ser!

A Ferrystone will spirit you back to Gran<cf>Soren in an instant, no matter where you<cf>are located.
It is by far the fastest and safest method<cf>of travel, but each stone disappears after<cf>a single use.
You can equip yourself with a primary and<cf>a secondary weapon.
Primary weapons such as swords and daggers<cf>are combat essentials. Secondary weapons<cf>like bows and shields offer support.
In addition to weapons and armor, you can<cf>also equip accoutrements with certain special<cf>abilities to give you an edge in battle.
Only one piece of jewelry and a single<cf>cloak can be equipped as accoutrements<cf>at any one time.
A heavy load will cause your Stamina to<cf>deplete more quickly. Sell or discard<cf>any and all items you no longer need.
Your lantern consumes oil. If it dims,<cf>use a Flask of Oil to refill it.
Some items can be combined with others to<cf>produce surprising results. Experiment and<cf>see what you come up with. 
Place waypoint markers on your map to<cf>keep track of your progress.
If you've forgotten where you are in the story,<cf>select "Chronicle" from the Pause Menu to<cf>review a history of your journey thus far.
Select "Options" from the Pause Menu to<cf>customize your mini-map and status display.
The higher the fall, the more damage you<cf>will suffer.
Note that you move somewhat slower while<cf>your weapon is drawn.
Exhausting all Stamina will make you unable<cf>to act for a time. Take care to conserve<cf>energy!
You can attack while clinging to foes.
Petrifaction cannot be cured by normal<cf>magick, and is fatal if left untreated.
Use Secret Softener or the like to<cf>cure any petrified allies.
Your rank within a vocation rises as you<cf>defeat foes and complete quests. At higher<cf>ranks, a broader variety of skills are available.
Defeating foes and completing quests earns<cf>you more discipline, boosting your prowess<cf>in a vocation.
Pawns will collect and use items of their<cf>own volition.
You cannot carry or purchase items that<cf>would cause you to exceed your maximum<cf>encumbrance.
Press <TUTO><SIZE 25><ICON TOUCH></SIZE> while climbing down a ladder<cf>to descend quickly. 
If a pawn remains unconscious for too long,<cf>they will be forfeit.
Your support pawn has become forfeit, and<cf>returned to the realm whence they came.
Your main pawn has become forfeit,<cf>disappearing and returning to the rift.
You cannot join covenants with other pawns<cf>while your main pawn is forfeit.
Touch any riftstone to return your lost<cf>main pawn to your side.
If a support pawn is forfeit, any items<cf>they were carrying are sent to item storage.
You can send off departing pawns with a<cf>single item as a gift for their creator.
You can pass items to and from your pawns<cf>on the sub menu.
There's no end of requests to seek out new knowledge of the dragon these days.
I don't see how some old scrawlings will thwart a beast what can't be held by stone walls...
Might be that's why... They've no recourse but to hold out hope for some old magick ward.
Come, make haste!
No...
The Bluemoon Tower...
The floor is fallen through...<cf>Tread carefully, Master.
The floor is crumbled... 'Tis<cf>treacherous going.
A door... I wonder where it leads?
'Tis an impressive construct. Doubly<cf>so given its age.
Looks more a ritual hall than a<cf>rooftop, this.
The floor's crumbled away in<cf>places. Watch your step.
Would that we had seen this place<cf>at the height of its glory.
Quite the stairway...
'Tis a dizzying climb. I barely know<cf>which direction I'm pointed anymore...
Another path extends below, Master.
We can get outside if we jump down<cf>below.
'Tis written that this tower was built<cf>long, long ago, at a lord's behest.
No accounts remain of why, however.<cf>None know what purpose it served.
Some say it was a to ward against the<cf>wyrm; others, an altar to the old gods.
We've no way of knowing for certain.
Voices, Master. Seems the hunting<cf>party is within.
Let's join the others! Inside,<cf>Arisen, quickly!
Break down the door! 'Tis dangerous<cf>to linger here!
'Tis too sturdy to break...<cf>We must have it open.
A lever, on the far side! That ought<cf>open the door, Master!
'Tis rusted shut!
The griffin is close... Let's face<cf>the beast!
'Tis dangerous here! Retreat!
The griffin comes! Onward, Master!
We must help Ser Georg take down<cf>that gate!
Ah! Ser Westley!
Ser Westley needs our aid! We must<cf>attack from range, now!
It's too dangerous, Master! We must<cf>escape!
Hurry, Master!
Master... Make your choice known.
Enter a covenant

Fine selection.
"Looking for simple work?<cf> Pay a call to the alehouse."
"The inn has need of a competent hunter of monsters."
"Notice: Those without business there are to stay away from the Pawn Guild."
"Newly remodeled and open for business! Come let Madeleine treat you right."
"Black market activities within the slums will cease or be justly punished."
"Those without proper dispensation are not permitted on the castle grounds."
'Tis well empty... Madeleine is nowhere in sight.
That dagger looks familiar. Madeleine's, as you recall.
He's a peaceful look to him. As if he's merely sleeping...
'Tis broken beyond use.
Had you a bottle, you might take some of this with you.
'Tis more fragile than it looks. Best be gentle with it.
'Tis empty, now.
The notice board. 'Tis wise to keep an eye on it for work.
'Tis blocked! We must dispatch the beast first!
This sturdy chair would make a fine spot to mentor your main pawn, were they at hand...
As its said, best let sleeping dogs lie. Sleeping people, too.
You could attempt to strike up conversation...you just won't succeed.
It cannot be opened from here.
Once you have reached a certain level,<cf>you may go to the inn to undertake<cf>advanced vocations.
Materials collected during your travels<cf>can be used at shops or other locations<cf>to enhance your equipment. 
Portcrystals work in tandem with<cf>Ferrystones.
Embed this Portcrystal in the ground any<cf>place save a dungeon, and you can use<cf>a Ferrystone to return there in an instant.
Wakestones are miraculous items that can<cf>bring your character, pawn allies, or <cf>others back to life.
Treasure each Wakestone, for the fragments<cf>required to form them are quite rare, and<cf>each stone can only be used once.
Gather enough Wakestone Shards and<cf>they will automatically assemble to<cf>form a complete stone.
Notice boards across Gransys advertise<cf>quests -- errands and favors you can<cf>choose to undertake.
When you're connected online, your main<cf>pawn's attributes will be uploaded every<cf>time you rest at an inn.
Your main pawn will gain boons earned in<cf>other worlds at the inn, as well. Visit<cf>often to keep current on any developments.
Changing vocations comes with a cost to<cf>your discipline, so weigh the decision<cf>carefully before you commit.
Discipline points can be spent to<cf>learn useful augments and skills.
Skills and augments must be enabled in<cf>order to make use of them.
Some peddlers only accept rift crystals.<cf>They often carry uncommon items you'll<cf>not see for sale anywhere else.
Consult the "History" in the Pause Menu<cf>to view a record of all the pawns you've<cf>employed.
Break any law, and you may find yourself<cf>arrested and imprisoned.
You can't use items or change equipment in<cf>the castle dungeons, with few exceptions.
You are free once more, and can use items<cf>and change equipment as usual.
You can speak with and enlist the pawns<cf>you encounter in town or out on the roads.
Be wary near any body of water. Wade too<cf>deep and you might be enveloped by the<cf>fog-like monster known as the Brine.
Wander too deep or idle too long in the<cf>water and you'll fall unconscious, washing<cf>ashore later at some faraway place. 
The Black Cat deals in rare goods that<cf>cannot be found in normal shops.
If you misplace an important item, you may<cf>find it for sale here later.
The Black Cat can also create counterfeit<cf>versions of certain items for you.
These forgeries look just like, but do not<cf>possess the powers of, the real thing.<cf>Still, such items do have their uses...
If your party is overloaded, speak with a<cf>storehouse keeper to deposit items and<cf>equipment.
Anything in storage can be retrieved from<cf>any storehouse in the world.
You can also send items to storage from any<cf>resting spot. Keep your inventory neat and<cf>organized, and avoid being weighed down.
It's only here you can enable the skills<cf>and augments you learn. You cannot change<cf>them out in the field.
Core skills are enabled as soon as they<cf>are learned.
Check the Options menu to toggle whether<cf>or not your mini-map rotates as you turn.
Your main pawn will earn rift crystals<cf>while online in other worlds. Encourage<cf>other players to enlist your minion!
Sit at this special chair to mentor your<cf>main pawn.
For certain powerful magicks, incanting<cf>the same spell as a pawn will shorten the<cf>time required to cast it.
Downloadable content includes extra<cf>weapons, armor and more.
Some downloadable content can make your<cf>journey easier.
If you come upon a pawn equipped with<cf>strange or unfamiliar equipment, it<cf>could be downloadable content.
You can purchase downloadable content<cf>from the <NS>.
You can purchase downloadable content<cf>from the Xbox Live Marketplace.
Don't forget to enable skills and augments<cf>for your main pawn as well.
Performing actions that people dislike will<cf>decrease their affinity for you.
A Ferrystone will spirit you back to Gran<cf>Soren in an instant, no matter where you<cf>are located.

Locked, and by a special key. Seems you need<cf>a Void Key to open it.
'Tis caught on something. Perhaps it could open from the far side.
'Tis barred shut. Might be able to break the bolt.
'Tis shut tight.
'Tis no use at this hour. You'll have to come again later.
Best stop for now.
Seems they're closed.
Someone was here...
Lost them...
Gone...
Perhaps you've upset them.
There's naught to do here.
Best you moved on.
Not here...
The door is closed.
Shows no sign of opening.
There's aught there...
You don't see anything.
That smell...
Someone's near...
What's this...?
Fine view from here.
There's aught written here...
Must be a way to find something...
Smells delicious.
Perfect spot to place something.
You can almost reach...
There appears to be aught ahead.
That fall could kill.
'Tis dangerous to touch.
A strong blow might break it.
Perhaps if you came by night.
Perhaps if you came by day.
Perhaps if you came at dawn.
Perhaps if you came at dusk.
There's aught buried here...
You see no way up.
'Tis slick, this spot.
No use pressing any further.
No need to double back further.
No time for that now.
You cannot carry any more.
There may yet be aught lying about.
Seems there's naught you can take on at present.<cf>Best to try again later.
Perhaps with a bit of help...
Best you kept your weapon sheathed.
Is someone here...?
'Tis a place for tall folk.
'Tis a place for small folk.
Had you a woman in your band...
Had you a man in your band...
Had you a strong companion...
Had you a swift companion...
Had you a magick user...
Had you an apt climber...
Had you a skilled jumper...
This weapon will not help you.
That armor won't protect you.
You're ill equipped for this.
Seems it can't be used now.
You'll get no further use from it.
'Tis useless, now.
Hmm, not with your current equipment...
Not with your current party...
You hear aught from further in.
Enemies... They're close.
Best you got some rest.
You can carry no more!
You're too exhausted!
"Danger! Keep Out!"
"No Trespassing"
A sign.
Had you an Empty Flask, you might fill it here.
You'll get no further without a lantern.
'Tis dangerous to fumble about in the dark. Best find a light.
Best not just leave them.
If aught were left here, it would rot.
Best take care you don't get lost.
Best check the map.
You're due for a rest.
This place is dangerous by night.
This place is dangerous by day.
Breathtaking...
You'll get no further!
Seems you'll need to come back.
Nothing left here.
It looks fit to crumble.
Seems it could be moved...
It will not budge.
It will not open.
Seems you need a key.
Seems you need a Pickaxe here.
You yet lack the experience.
You yet lack the skill.
Not with your current vocation...
You'll not pass through this gate.
You've no time!
Seems you were too late.
You may make it, yet.
You're doing well for time.
Seems you've come at the wrong time.
There may be another path.
'Tis a powerful weapon... Too bad it doesn't work.
It won't budge. Seems you need to insert<cf>a Moonbeam Gem to open it.
Something strong can be sensed from the stone. It <cf>appears the memories of someone have been etched<cf>upon the surface of the Monument of Remembrance.
Oh, woe! Oh, calamity! 'Tis worse than the dragon's coming!
'Twould be a heartless brute indeed who ignored a fellow so aggrieved...
Oh, is there no one who can help me?
Hear him out
Ignore him
You'll hear my plight, friend? Oh, blessed relief! My faith in man's restored!
Truly, 'tis at times like these we must come together to... Aye? What's my trouble? Patience, friend!
'Tis a grave matter that demands a proper explanation. Shouldn't take more than a few hours or so to-- Are you listening?
Fine, fine! I'll be direct.
I brew an herb ale, but I've run short of plants to make it with.
The merchant who supplies me is nowhere to be found, and no one else stocks the herbs.
They only grow in a forsaken, beast-plagued patch of wild called the Witchwood, and look no different from any other weed to the untrained eye.
There's naught to do but bargain directly with the witch who makes her home there.
You're the noble sort, aye? Champion to the people? Then pray, go and fetch us some herbs from that witch, won't you?
'Tis easy work, in exchange for heartfelt thanks!
Quite the bargain, I'm sure you'll agree? And one I am happy to extend!
A kind and valorous sort would ne'er leave a fellow in such distress, nor anyone with the faintest sense of duty.
Alas, the world holds its share of callous, twisted misanthropes...
Oh, woe! Oh, cruelest fate!
Surely the world will heed my cries for help now! 'Tis not so cruel as to leave a man so beset to suffer alone!
Well? What say you, ser!?
Hear him out
Ignore him
What, forgotten the task already? Fine, fine. I'll explain it anew...
Would you have the thorough one-hour lecture or the abridged 10-minute... Aye? 10 seconds?
...Well played, ser.
As you wish. Make for the Witchwood and fetch some herbs for alemaking.
Did that get the point across? It seems so abrupt...
Ah, you've brought the herbs! I knew it from the aroma the moment you walked in!
These will keep the house ale flowing, to the delight of my regular patrons.
They'll have their drink, and I their custom, and you the warm feeling come from charity work.
We are winners, all, in this. Would that there were more such opportunities, eh, friend?
...Well, as it so happens, there are! Many of my patrons come begging favors, and I'm eager to help...long as there's coin in it...
I shall post their requests to the notice board as they come. Pray, have a look when you've the time.
No doubt you will find aught that tickles your spirit of charity!
You can accept tasks there at the board, then report your successes to me. Simple, aye?
Well, best of luck. Pray, return soon, and often.
Ah, completed a request, have you? Wonderful, wonderful...
Here, friend. The wages for your efforts. A pleasure, as always!
Taken on a request, have you? Best of luck, then!
I see you're hard at work on an errand, friend. Pray, take all the time you need.
Truly, man is a marvelous creature.
Even in these dire times, desires abound. Where desperation might well take hold, dreams instead arise.
As long as man yet dreams, this world will manage well enough, mark my words.
That makes folk in the trade of making dreams turn true the saviors of the world, eh? Folk like you and me.
'Tis work well worth doing!
I've no use for you.
Keep your distance, filth.
You've no place here.
Aanh?
Be off with you.
Why are you here?
Don't get cocky, you.
Scared, are you?
To living easy, aye?
Hoy there. You look eager.
"Dragon," "heart," and "scar," is it? Hmm...
Does it have aught to do with that drawing? The figure of Hillfigure Knoll.
You know it, aye? The man drawn upon the hill north of the capital.
He bears a scar across the heart. Or the chest, at least.
Ah...
Aah!
Aaaaaagh!
Hmh.
Hngh!
Are you well?
Pray, take care...
Yes...
No...
My thanks...
Never have I known such happiness.
Do you need for anything?
If there is aught I can do, say it.
Have you decided?
As you wish.
Until next time, then.
I regret you haven't enough, ser...
Have we a deal?
I shall keep it safe.
Here you are.
Understood.
I fear I cannot...
You... You can see me.
Then you are one known to the dragon,<cf>bound within the eternal ring.
I have dire need of the Arisen's strength.<cf>Please, ser, will you lend me your aid?
Yes
No
The boon I ask can be granted only by one<cf>with ties to the wyrm. I beseech you, ser.
I have dire need of the Arisen's strength.<cf>Please, ser, will you lend me your aid?
You have my eternal thanks...
You speak now to a shadow of sorts. My<cf>flesh resides elsewhere.
I would take you there now, if it please you.
This shadow can but point the way, ser.
Shall I see you to the island?
Yes
No
Then I shall await you here.
We stand now on Bitterblack Isle, far asea<cf>from the cove we departed.
I would ask you to explore its depths.
From its deepest heart, I sense the will of<cf>one such as yourself, touched by the wyrm.
I beg you, ser... Find that lost soul, and<cf>lead it to redemption.
Were it possible, I would not send you off<cf>with so meager an explanation.
But I fear I myself do not know it better.<cf>My past, my aims in coming here, all of it<cf>is lost as in a fog.
All I know is that I, like you, was called<cf>here, and am bound to stay. I sensed you in<cf>the distance, and called to you for help.
I knew somehow, as by instinct, that you could<cf>grant the wish of the one who dwells below.
Just as I know my role here is to aid you in that<cf>pursuit.
I am versed in the purifaction of cursed<cf>artifacts.
Should you, in your travels, find such ensorceled<cf>objects, pray bring them to me.
The procedure requires but a few rift<cf>crystals, and it is a service I would<cf>gladly tender.
My hope is that I may rediscover myself,<cf>and recall my true purpose here.
I shall aid your journey in any way I can, and<cf>pray that our goals both lie together.
It is with heavy heart I say the man you<cf>have brought back from below is not the one<cf>I seek.
He is but another traveler, brought here from<cf>another world.
I shall aid you however I can... For therein<cf>lies my own path forward.
Pray, take care...
'Tis slow work, but I've been endeav'ring<cf>to remember more about myself.
...It seems I, too, was one linked to the<cf>wyrm by fate.
In my questing, I came to this place, yet...<cf>the will of some other entity took hold of<cf>me, and bound me here.
The words I spoke begging your aid were not mine,<cf>but theirs...
Beyond that is still a haze.
What am I meant to do here, truly?<cf>...Forgive me. 'Tis not a query you could<cf>answer when I myself know not.
For now, my course is unchanged. I shall<cf>help as I am able, and pray that brings<cf>further clarity.
Take care, ser...
Older memories are bubbling to the surface...<cf>though they show a past which is not my own.
I recall fighting... I was in the service of a great<cf>warrior, and together we overcame many trials.
Her ill-deserved end was a crushing blow to me<cf>as well. My soul was shattered.
...Much as I then came to shatter his.
What recollections I have seem so vivid, and yet<cf>all else beyond them is a haze...
I feel my soul is an amalgam of my own and that<cf>of someone else, as two halves of a single whole...
Strangely, the thought causes me no distress.
The truth remains that if I am to save him,<cf>I need your help, Arisen.
Please... Be careful.
It grows clearer, now... My circumstances<cf>here, and what it is I must do.
I am not... The soul that animates this<cf>body is not its natural pair.
But I had to save him, at any cost...
The master of this black isle. He created<cf>these labyrinthine halls, and has the power<cf>to draw Arisen into them.
In my desperation to see him redeemed, I<cf>wrested away control of this body...
I must believe my claiming this body... my<cf>calling you here held some meaning.
The truth remains that if I am to save him,<cf>I need your help, Arisen.
Please... Be careful.
You've met him...
He was my master, though it was a hundred<cf>lifetimes past.
When he came to face the dragon, he was<cf>given a choice too hard, too cruel to make.
He could live with neither answer, and so he<cf>offered only a curse in reply. Those words<cf>saw him become the monster he is now.
In granting him the cursed form he chose,<cf>the wyrm had held to its bargain... and I<cf>was the price.
I was his pawn, and his beloved besides.
Please... You must free him.
Let your iron will be as a hammer to shatter<cf>the bonds of hate that keep him here.
And if freedom is beyond his reach, pray offer him<cf>at least a peaceful end...
Please, ser... I beg you to help him.
Let your will prove the stronger, and crush<cf>the bonds of enmity that hold him.
His soul has been a slave too long. Pray,<cf>bring his suff'ring to a merciful end...
Only a stronger will... A will as yours can bring<cf>him peace.
You go with all my hopes...
I feel as if freshly awakened from some<cf>long dream...
Yet I heard clear each word exchanged 'tween you<cf>and the one who possessed me. I remember them<cf>still.
That woman... She, too, was named Olra.<cf>Perhaps it was that chance bond that led<cf>her spirit to me.
And through me, she called to you. To one<cf>whose strength of will outmatched the master<cf>of this place.
Arisen or no, my own will seems a guttering<cf>candle to your sun.
...I shall remain here awhile, I think. To<cf>contemplate the meaning of our meeting here.
The meaning of the Arisen's charge, of the<cf>quest to reclaim one's heart... The more I<cf>think upon it all, the murkier it grows.
That monstrous thing yet lives?
The Arisen who brought this place into being<cf>is gone, but perhaps some other force yet<cf>remains which fueled his long grudge...
Pray, permit me to help you now, as before.<cf>I would dearly welcome the sense of purpose.
Do be careful...
In my earliest memories, I am...standing here, on<cf>this jetty. I hear a voice.
It entreated me to save...someone.
Upon hearing her words, I fell into a terrible<cf>confusion.
It felt as if... As if that voice had been my own.
I fear there is little more I can tell you about<cf>the one I brought you here to aid.
'Tis a mad request, I know.
I scarce know who I am, let alone this other soul...
And yet, at my core, it is their fate, not my own,<cf>that weighs more heavily upon me.
You are Arisen, like as me.
Chosen of the wyrm, and lead by it... Or a sacrificial<cf>lamb at the altar of its cruel dogma. Which telling<cf>is the truer, I know not.
I ask you--is that the fate you've chosen, of your<cf>own will?
...A foolish question.
Whatever outward circumstances may act upon a<cf>person, their fate is, in the end, a thing of their<cf>own making.
That holds as true for the Arisen as any other.
I... I died once. Here, in this place.
It was scarce a fortnight after I was first lured in.
Each day brought new losses. My pawn was slain,<cf>then gradually my store of curatives dwindled.
I was surrounded, body battered and broken by dark<cf>and powerful magicks. As death approached, I lifted<cf>my gaze to see the stars one final time.
Yet it was not death that engulfed me then, but a<cf>strange light, far brighter than any fire of the<cf>empyrean. ...Past that, my memory fails.
You know of them, do you not? The wyrm. The<cf>Seneschal. The roles they play, and the bargain<cf>they offer.
It is not a choice to be made lightly, and either<cf>path holds its own pain...
But what if both paths in equal part meant<cf>betraying that which you held dearest, and<cf>forsaking all you'd believed?
A man can pick the lesser of two evils, but 'tis an<cf>impossible dilemma when those evils are one and<cf>the same.
Yet pick he must, for indecision and escape invite<cf>evils far worse...
I do not believe that seeking one's own death is<cf>ever the proper course.
'Tis only effort and the unbending will to press on<cf>that sees ill circumstance improved. In death, we<cf>can change nothing.
Yet there are rare times, I believe, when the<cf>destruction of the body IS the path to further<cf>progress.
I do not make light of your decision, nor mean to<cf>imply it was one easily or painless made.
But through it, you have come to live anew. To<cf>meet me here, a denizen of another world.
It was because your will shone brighter, proved<cf>stronger than any other that you reached your end,<cf>and for that same cause you stand here now.
Why do you fight, ser?
To ward the ones you love from evil? To claim<cf>authority o'er the land as conqueror?
'Tis a question all warriors, Arisen or nay, must<cf>ever ask themselves.
...Lest somewhere in the sea of blood and the<cf>seductions of strength we come to find fighting<cf>has become the end and not the means.
Even for one with will enough to earn the dragon's<cf>mark, that siren's song is fearsome strong.
Never have I known such happiness.
<RMVC>I shall aid you however I can... For therein<cf>lies my own path forward.

You can equip yourself with a primary and<cf>a secondary weapon.
Primary weapons such as swords and daggers<cf>are combat essentials. Secondary weapons<cf>like bows and shields offer support.
In addition to weapons and armor, you can<cf>also equip accoutrements with certain special<cf>abilities to give you an edge in battle.
Only one piece of jewelry and a single<cf>cloak can be equipped as accoutrements<cf>at any one time.
A heavy load will cause your Stamina to<cf>deplete more quickly. Sell or discard<cf>any and all items you no longer need.
Your lantern consumes oil. If it dims,<cf>use a Flask of Oil to refill it.
Some items can be combined with others to<cf>produce surprising results. Experiment and<cf>see what you come up with. 
Place waypoint markers on your map to<cf>keep track of your progress.
If you've forgotten where you are in the story,<cf>select "Chronicle" from the Pause Menu to<cf>review a history of your journey thus far.
Select "Options" from the Pause Menu to<cf>customize your mini-map and status display.
The higher the fall, the more damage you<cf>will suffer.
Note that you move somewhat slower while<cf>your weapon is drawn.
Exhausting all Stamina will make you unable<cf>to act for a time. Take care to conserve<cf>energy!
You can attack while clinging to foes.
Petrifaction cannot be cured by normal<cf>magick, and is fatal if left untreated.
Use Secret Softener or the like to<cf>cure any petrified allies.
Your rank within a vocation rises as you<cf>defeat foes and complete quests. At higher<cf>ranks, a broader variety of skills are available.
Defeating foes and completing quests earns<cf>you more discipline, boosting your prowess<cf>in a vocation.
Pawns will collect and use items of their<cf>own volition.
You cannot carry or purchase items that<cf>would cause you to exceed your maximum<cf>encumbrance.
Press <TUTO><SIZE 25><ICON TOUCH></SIZE> while climbing down a ladder<cf>to descend quickly. 
If a pawn remains unconscious for too long,<cf>they will be forfeit.
Your support pawn has become forfeit, and<cf>returned to the realm whence they came.
Your main pawn has become forfeit,<cf>disappearing and returning to the rift.
You cannot join covenants with other pawns<cf>while your main pawn is forfeit.
Touch any riftstone to return your lost<cf>main pawn to your side.
If a support pawn is forfeit, any items<cf>they were carrying are sent to item storage.
You can send off departing pawns with a<cf>single item as a gift for their creator.
You can pass items to and from your pawns<cf>on the sub menu.
Now I think on it, I found this not long ago.
Long as I have you here, I ought pass it on to you.
You know of the witch what lives in those woods?
His Grace is keen to seek out the old crone. Even now, he gathers men for a search party.
Hmm? You would know more of the witch?
Rumors swirl of late, most on how she speaks with the dragon. Consorts with him, more like, some say...
Others claim she summoned the wyrm herself...
Whatever the case, we could do worse than seek her counsel if she knows aught of the beast.
Speak with the soldiers to hear more of the witch. Even now, they mount an expedition to find her.
Oy, won't be long now, eh?
Ohh!
Such a grand structure...
I've ne'er seen its like...
'Tis an open construction, for a<cf>hold. Look there, the sky.
You could evenly fight any beast<cf>from here.
More open spaces...
Seems it's locked by some special<cf>means.
Perhaps it's the treasury.
A portion of the wall is fallen...
A room for interrogations...
Mayhap the men of the Wall could<cf>open it?
The men of the hold could have it<cf>open, no doubt.
'Tis vast... A meeting hall or the like?
What goes on in this room?
Seems we've reached the roof.
'Tis a store of powder kegs.
Those powder kegs could set a<cf>fragile wall to crumbling.
The once-proud hold lies ruined...
Such a grand keep fell in a moment's<cf>time before the wyrm...a terrible beast.
There's aught over here!

No! The trail can't grow cold now...
Oh, Father... Where are you?
Hear him out
Ignore him
What in the Maker's name is the Arisen--
No. Who am I to question Fortune's gift?
Please, help me find my father.
He's a gardener in His Grace Duke Edmun's castle.
I awoke one morning to find him vanished without a word. It's not like him at all!
I've searched for near on a week now, but found nothing.
I beg your aid, Ser Arisen -- I've truly nowhere else to turn. 
Take this. My father will know it on first glance.
Maker speed your steps.
Where could he be...?
My father's a simple gardener -- there's no reason for him to just disappear.
I wonder if aught happened at work...
I'd search the castle for clues, but I'm not of age and a commoner besides -- they'd never grant me leave.
Would you go to the castle and search in my place, Ser Arisen?
Someone in the castle knows what's become of my father, I just know it.
Father!
I heard tell the Arisen made for the capital, and prayed to find you here.
I can't even imagine what they must have done to you...but it's all over now.
I owe you so much, Arisen. Thank you.
M-my father...<cf>Where is he?
...D-dead? No... 
Curse the Maker! Why... Why did he have to die!?
And with the Arisen at his side...
...Please...leave me in peace.
I've nothing more to say to you...
I've nothing more to say to you...
I owe you so much, Arisen. Thank you.
Think you're clever, do you?
What will become of me here? 'Tis the sole thought that has occupied me for an age.
But now... Now I grow weary of even that.
Graaaaough…
Nagh...! Y...you...!
...Rraaaaaugh!
Yes...!
I... I must...feed! ...Slake my...hunger!
Your heart... Give it here!
Graaaagh! What... What is...!?
Agh... Ah!? Who... Who are you!?
What have I... I... Ngh? Waaaaugh!
Eras, macto!<cf>(Slay your master!)
Ile'eo, to quento!<cf>(Yield unto death!)
Gaaah... Augh... I... I'm…
Ego! Ves, medo'a!<cf>(I am devourer!)
A queer light shines up through the floor, accompanied by a gentle breeze.
It seems a larger space lies beyond.

Are you trying to piss me off?
Look at me again and I'll claw out your eyes!
Leave!
Looking for a fight, are you?
Watch your step, friend.
What is it?
Shut yer tooth-hole.
Fobbing codpiece...
What say we have a cup later? On you, of course.
Good to see you, friend!
...The hell're you doin' here?
Get outta here!
What was that? You want a beating?
Step away before I smack you in the face.
Who said you could talk to me, anyway?
So, you DO want to die!
Go. Away!
You're batty as a belfry!
Do I have to pay you to go away?
You again?
How goes it?
Yo!
Those bitches...!
This is ridiculous!
No way!
Best to have slaughtered them long ago.
They'll get theirs...soon.
Aye, we will...
Hmm?
Ahhh...
And?
What? Who are... Our landlord would drive us from our home?
Forget it! I won't go!
I don't care how wealthy he is! He can't simply toss us out!
I'll never leave! Ever! Not in a thousand years!
No, no! My mind is made up!
Now stop chasing me! Just leave me be!
You don't give up, do you?
And I was taught that Arisen were friends of the weak...
...Oh, what does it matter?
Even I ken that any who cross Fournival find work hard to come by.
And Father isn't like to stand against one so powerful... What choice do we have?
Well, so be it. I daresay I won't miss that pigsty of a home, besides.
Now if there's nothing else, pray leave me be.
Maker curse that Fournival! Thinks his wealth lets him do whatever he pleases....
A shame the dragon didn't start with him as a snack...
I hear you saved our home.
I...I was wrong about you, Arisen.
I have little to offer, but please, take this in thanks.
Pfft! What good are Arisen if not to help small folk such as us?
What? What do you want?
That hole, it...it swallowed my parents...
You're to blame for this! It's your meddling that set things in motion.
Damn your eyes, Arisen! Why did... Why did this happen to me?
Damn your eyes, Arisen! Why did... Why did this happen to me?
Damned bird, fleeing to its roost the moment its fortunes turn...
We cannot let this chance escape. Come, Arisen. To the Bluemoon Tower!

Beg pardon, cousin. Have you seen Valmiro?
I wager he's on another mad quest for flowers, or bugs, or whatever takes his fancy of late...
It's a bother, but we can't very well leave him to wander off to his death... Would you help me find him?
Accept
Not now
Many thanks, cousin. We should ask the other villagers afore all else.
One of them must have some word of him.
Ah, I see... Well, perhaps he'll wander back on his own ere long...
And all in one piece, I pray...
Forgive me, cousin. Valmiro's fate still weighs heavy on my mind. What if he...
Please -- let us search for him together.
Accept
Not now
See if we can't find a witness or two about the village.
Valmiro's antics are hard to miss, and harder still to forget. I'm sure someone will recall him.
I'm pleased to see Valmiro about, and none the worse for wear, it would seem.
He's a wandering spirit. I know it pains him to cause worry, but he can't manage otherwise.
In any case, cousin, you have my thanks.

I ill like the look of this cave...<cf>Stay vigilant.
The air is chill... Is there water within?
Seems it opens into a larger cavern...
The bridge is fallen...
We must find another path.
The bridge has rotted through. Hmm...
We're the first to be here in years.
Slip from here and our journey<cf>comes to an abrupt end...
I'd warrant that's a one-way fall,<cf>Master.
This place is haunted with phantasms.
Phantasms, Master. Best brace for<cf>lightning.
All these snow harpies... Must be a<cf>nest close by.
Winged monsters seem to favor the<cf>terrain here.
'Tis an aerie to harpies and gargoyles.
This canyon links the capital with the<cf>west of Gransys.
A fall from these heights will shorten<cf>a leg, or a lifespan.
Krgh.
Gwaugh!
Ngh...gaah...
Hmph!
Shaah!
I trust you are well, ser?
By your leave, ser.
Yes.
No...
My humblest thanks.
I hardly merit such generosity, ser.
May I be of service?
Ah, the Arisen. Well met, ser.
His Grace told me to expect you, ser.
You are to be freely admitted to the castle as need demands.
Something further, ser? I should think us servants of little concern to you.
In my humble opinion, we ought simply quit this place. The castle, the city, Gransys...
But His Grace bears the title Dragonsbane for having slain the beast once before.
He cannot abandon his people to it now.
In my humble opinion, we ought simply quit this place. The castle, the city, Gransys...
I hardly merit such generosity, ser.
Hmm, could be it's a mistake to press on. Could be it's not.

Death to the traitor!
Who let you in here?
Piss off!
Who d'you fancy you are?
You're not welcome here.
This isn't the place for a stroll, outsider.
Eager to die, friend?
Be off with you!
You half-faced rabbit-sucker...
Haven't you any better way to spend your time?
Still here, are you?
How do you fare?
Hoy!
Those rotten...
'Tis a poor jest...
...Truly?
We ought to have finished them earlier.
We'll do for them, we will...
Aye, we will...
What?
I see...
And what then?

From a Different Sky
Aaaugh! S-stay back!
Aaaugh!
Ngh.
Hnngh!
Guhagh...nngh...
Yoh!
Taah!
'Ello, 'ello.
Fare well, then. Fare well.
Oh, aye.
That's just not so.
Sorry for the trouble.
Say, that's lovely, ser.
Say, that's lovely, ser.
I owe you my life, ser. Thank you.
There are still others held below. Pray, free them as well!
Leave no beast unslain!
We cannot let these monsters live.
It may be over there...
'Tis more than we can handle...
Such might...!<cf>We'd best escape while we can!
We must hurry! There's no time!
The deadline draws near, ser.
A monster!
There, a monster! It's seen us!
Ready, ser?
Take care, Arisen!<cf>Sea monsters prowl the shoreline.
Let's make use of these explosives.
Let none of them survive!
Some beasts still remain.
We've been eluded...
No harm must come to our charge.
Leave it to me, Master.
Best we were more watchful than ever.
We are safely arrived.
'Tis our destination.
Do not let them from your sight, Arisen!
I've not seen a view that rivals it...
Gransys is rife with spots fit to steal one's<cf>breath away.
We must go through here.
How should we go?
Which way?
I suppose we aren't there yet...
Let us check the map afore we lose<cf>our way.
Our attacks do nothing!?<cf>If we could hold him still...
Working together, we can deal the<cf>final blow!
While he prepares his massive attack,<cf>we must act to stop him!
A monk's remains...<cf>We'd best report this.
Let's continue searching.<cf>It must be here somewhere.
This "Night's Champion" seems to<cf>know much of castle happenings.
The disquiet within the castle must be<cf>tied to the Night's Champion...
The Night's Champion...<cf>Mayhap you'd best learn more.
Salvation... Was there not a man rumored to<cf>be connected with them?
The neighboring countries have a pact to lend<cf>aid to any land assaulted by the dragon.
This "Night's Champion" could have taken<cf>advantage of the disorder to come from some<cf>foreign land.
I am sorry, I know nothing...
Let us follow this road.
Continue to the next junction.
Shall we find this Dragonforged?<cf>He can lend us advice, like as not.
Finally...the Dragonforged's abode.
Go, enter. You have much to talk about.
Listen to the Dragonforged.
The Dragonforged knows the dragon like no<cf>other. He was once an Arisen, and challenged<cf>the dragon, long ago.
Nowadays, none can see the Dragonforged<cf>but you, Arisen, and we pawns.
The Dragonforged's companion was once his<cf>closest pawn.
Surely the Dragonforged's knowledge will be<cf>of use to you, Arisen.
The capital is certainly a different feel from<cf>Cassardis. Arisen, why not rest from your<cf>journey?
So lively, as expected from the capital.<cf>First, let's rest and recover.
Somehow, we escaped...<cf>'Tis all thanks to you, Arisen.
This Wakestone obtained from the<cf>Dragonforged... I am sure it will prove useful.
Ah.
Wagh!
Aaaaugh...
Ha.
Yaah!
You look well.
Take care, cos.
Aye.
I think not...
Thank you!
My thanks, goodfisher! You are a dear!
Yes? What?
Leave me be, fisher.
Fretting's for the idle, says I.
If crying solved aught, I'd shed some tears.
Best make the most of what time we have, aye?
No time left for dallying about, eh?
Leave the warring to the warriors, I say.
Are there more of those...those creatures hiding about?
Perhaps 'tis time I left this place...
What does it all mean, cousin?
You look well.
Thank you!
Quite the gate. What do you suppose<cf>lies beyond?
We could use that ballista, had we<cf>a way to it...
We can climb up to the ballista<cf>from here.
That should take us to the hold's<cf>upper floors.
Shall we climb up and survey the area?
This will let us strike at foes from afar.
Firing a ballista is simple. Even<cf>goblins manage it, after all.
Hmm, 'tis shut fast... How do you<cf>suppose we open it?
Here's the gate control, but<cf>where's the lever?
Hmm, no luck... It must open from<cf>the far side.
There's aught here, Arisen.
The lever to open the gate, perhaps?
A hole...? Dug by the goblins, no<cf>doubt.
Through here and we'll be to the<cf>goblins' den.
'Tis too dangerous to attempt<cf>ourselves.
'Tis quite small...
We can like jump inside from here,<cf>Master.
An Innocent Man
Tomlin has come to Cassardis in search of his<cf>missing father. Like as not, you will need to visit<cf>the capital for clues.

Seems this hill will get us up above.
This path leads upward.
There's naught we can do!<cf>Run through!
Come, run!
Let's away for now! This way!
We can fight it here!
We'll strike back here!
We'll retreat to that tower. We can<cf>strike it from the rooftop!
Give it a taste of the ballista!
I believe 'tis that way!
Be careful!
Watch your step.
Watch your step.
I've a very bad feeling about all this...
After them!
There's a way up here.
Forgive the sudden request, ser, but I find myself in need of something, and thought you might be of service?
If you find it, return here to me and I will compensate you most generously.
Remember the item I asked you find? It's not urgent, but I do hope you might yet locate it...
Well, enough of that. To business, then.
Ah, that's it exactly! Allow me to discount your fare in thanks.
If ever I need your services again, I shall not hesitate to ask.
I find myself in need of another item, ser. 
As you performed so admirably last time, I thought I might seek your aid again.
Pray, remember the item I asked you find? It's not urgent, but I do hope you might yet locate it...
Well, enough of that. To business, then.
That's it! Amazing...as I've come to expect from the likes of you, ser...
In thanks, I offer a further discount on your bill.
In truth, ser, you are my finest patron.
Whenever I've requested aid, you lent it without question. I feel I can trust you...
Perhaps the time is right to reveal what I am truly searching for.
I... I never knew my father. He disappeared while I was yet in my mother's belly. Truth be told, he's just as like dead by now...
Yet, the question haunts me still: What could so vex a man that he might desert his unborn child?
I have no desire to weigh the right of his actions. I seek only the cause behind them.
Thus did I become a peddler, that I could wander the land in search of clues.
Pray, if you should come across any trace of my father -- some record of his travels, or a diary, perhaps -- I would ask you bring it to me.
I've found naught in all my years of searching, but perhaps you might succeed where I failed.
Fair sense tells me otherwise, but yet I hold out hope.
Apologies, ser. I know it is no simple thing I asked of you.
It will take time, no doubt... I do not expect evidence of my father to be found easily.
Yet he must have left aught behind...some clue to his history. A log of his travels, perhaps...
Trust I will continue the search for my part as well... But now, to business.
Hold!
This... These letters...they are written in my father's hand!<cf>...I see. Spread out o'er all the land, were they?
I cannot fathom the trouble you bore to find this. I am at a loss for words, ser...
And yet, it seems my father is well and truly dead after all.
Please, do not worry yourself on this. Simply finding aught of him is a treasure to me.
I shall read this anon. Perhaps I may finally learn the cause behind his travels...
In any case, the finest patron deserves the finest reward!
Please, ser: Accept this gift with my compliments.
In truth, I warrant this will be my final transaction. With the mystery of my father resolved, I've little reason to wander the land any longer.
Maker guide your steps until our paths cross again...

I'll make no promises...
I'll bide my time and observe, for now...
Here it comes...
This ought to be good...
My, my...
More agile than it looks.
Feint all you like. I see you...
Hup!
What in blazes!?
Impressive, for an overfed rooster.
There! Now!
How does it taste, buzzard?
We're up against mean odds...
Rgh!
I'd hoped a...more heroic death...
Waaaugh!
No! Ser Cyrus...! Rrrraaaaaagh!
You ought not have angered me, beast!
I shall see you avenged, Cyrus. I swear it!
Vengeance... I'd hoped to end this day without cause for vengeance...
I owe you a round of ale, ser.
For all its plumage, the beast had the temper of a hellcat.
'Tis a grim thought that we live in a world teeming with such beasts...
Still, 'tis the fact of it. We can but keep living best we're able.
Such a grand house of worship, isn't it?
This place serves as a hub among the land's abbeys, where our members correspond.
Not that we find time for such matters, now the dragon's upon us.
The church sends its most devout to the Grand Cathedral in Auldring to study.
I'd dearly love to see it myself, but I'm far from the brightest here.
What!? The dragon, come so close?
Living in this place has a way of making the world outside feel so distant...
Still, there's naught I can do but pray.
Something frightful is afoot, isn't it?
Have we been spared the dragon's wrath, or does destruction beckon just the same?
'Tis locked. You haven't the key to fit it...
'Tis caught on something. Perhaps it could open from the far side.
'Tis barred shut. Might be able to break the bolt.
'Tis shut tight.
'Tis no use at this hour. You'll have to come again later.
Best stop for now.
Seems they're closed.
Someone was here...
Lost them...
Gone...
Perhaps you've upset them.
There's naught to do here.
Best you moved on.
Not here...
The door is closed.
Shows no sign of opening.
There's aught there...
You don't see anything.
That smell...
Someone's near...
What's this...?
Fine view from here.
There's aught written here...
Must be a way to find something...
Smells delicious.
Perfect spot to place something.
You can almost reach...
There appears to be aught ahead.
That fall could kill.
'Tis dangerous to touch.
A strong blow might break it.
Perhaps if you came by night.
Perhaps if you came by day.
Perhaps if you came at dawn.
Perhaps if you came at dusk.
There's aught buried here...
You see no way up.
'Tis slick, this spot.
No use pressing any further.
No need to double back further.
No time for that now.
You cannot carry any more.
There may yet be aught lying about.
Seems there's naught you can take on at present.<cf>Best to try again later.
Perhaps with a bit of help...
Best you kept your weapon sheathed.
Is someone here...?
'Tis a place for tall folk.
'Tis a place for small folk.
Had you a woman in your band...
Had you a man in your band...
Had you a strong companion...
Had you a swift companion...
Had you a magick user...
Had you an apt climber...
Had you a skilled jumper...
This weapon will not help you.
That armor won't protect you.
You're ill equipped for this.
Seems it can't be used now.
You'll get no further use from it.
'Tis useless, now.
Hmm, not with your current equipment...
Not with your current party...
You hear aught from further in.
Enemies... They're close.
Best you got some rest.
You can carry no more!
You're too exhausted!
"Danger! Keep Out!"
"No Trespassing"
A sign.
Had you an Empty Flask, you might fill it here.
You'll get no further without a lantern.
'Tis dangerous to fumble about in the dark. Best find a light.
Best not just leave them.
If aught were left here, it would rot.
Best take care you don't get lost.
Best check the map.
You're due for a rest.
This place is dangerous by night.
This place is dangerous by day.
Breathtaking...
You'll get no further!
Seems you'll need to come back.
Nothing left here.
It looks fit to crumble.
Seems it could be moved...
It will not budge.
It will not open.
Seems you need a key.
Seems you need a Pickaxe here.
You yet lack the experience.
You yet lack the skill.
Not with your current vocation...
You'll not pass through this gate.
You've no time!
Seems you were too late.
You may make it, yet.
You're doing well for time.
Seems you've come at the wrong time.
There may be another path.
'Tis a powerful weapon... Too bad it doesn't work.
Circle back to the labyrinth entrance?<cf>(If you do, you will not be able to immediately <cf>return here.)
Uh!
Ungh!
Eeaaagh...
Hnh!
Taah!
H-hello.
Fare...well.
Aye...
No...
Thank you.
Thank you, ser. Truly.
I've lost my father... Where could he have got off to?
He wouldn't run off for fear of the dragon. Not Father!
Thank you again for all you've done, Arisen.
From me and my father, both...
I aim to study as a gardener.
Times are hard, and I am eager to learn a trade that pays.
D-do not mistake me, ser. 'Tis not that I simply wish to follow in my father's footsteps.
Why are you still here?
Go. Slay the dragon and win us all a bit of peace.
Pray, let me find him quickly...
Like as not, he's sick with worry searching for me as well.
What? It's too late now. It's too late.
This is how it all ends...
Nothing remains... Nothing endures at all.
Thank you, ser. Truly.
Ngh.
Hnngh...
Aaaugh...
Hah!
Eagh!
Greetings.
Maker speed your steps.
Yes.
No.
I thank you.
Your kindness humbles me.
Prophecy foretold the dragon was come unto this land again, that much I knew.
But to see the beast come ashore in our own village!
What a fearsome sight...
Truly, the beast is death made flesh. It stands in violation of the Maker's blessed mercy!
I grieve for those who are gone, but we were fortunate to lose so few, by the Maker's grace.
May He ever watch over us and be our shield!
Slowly but surely, the village is recovering its calm.
Perhaps the Faith is not the greatest support in their lives...
But, newly arrived though I may be, I am a resident of this<cf>village.
I must profess the glory and the blessings of the Maker to all who live here!
And I promise I will do everything I can to make this happen.
You needn't trouble yourself any further on my behalf. The matter is settled.
All things find their way, given the time.
I have a message from the Grand Cathedral.
The group known as Salvation clouds men's souls with chaos and obstructs their belief in the Faith.
You must not give any support to that group.
Truth be told, I have little idea what Salvation is, exactly.
And as long as that is the case, I have little idea how I am expected to deal with them.
Have you spoken with Auster yet?
Auster arrived to the village not long after the dragon attack.
He came from the mainland, in hopes of researching Cassardis itself, it seems.
I did not inquire further upon his journey at the time...
But helping those in need is a core belief of all the Maker's servants.
I understand Auster is well-learned when it comes to ancient scriptures and other texts.
If you come across anything he might help you with, do not be afraid to ask him.
I am sure he would be delighted to be of service.
I am lost in a deep well of thought at the moment...
I am trying to determine where my faith lies...and where the truth of this divine judgment should be found.
How should I think, how should I reason, in order to fully understand our current plight?
I'm afraid I haven't a clue.
I must profess the glory and the blessings of the Maker to all who live here!
I thank you.
You say it's left a glowing scar?
Yes. The wound has closed,<cf>and it seems the worst has passed, but...
His heart lies silent!
Her heart lies silent!
If you would face me...
You're sure o' this?<cf>
...Yes.
Ill magick... The work of some curse!
The whole world's already gone mad<cf>for fear o' this dragon...
Won't no good come o' this.
I must go see to the others, Quina.
Tell me if aught changes here.
Alright.
If there's training to be done, we'd best<cf>do it.
'Tis always wise to hone one's skills.
That went poorly...
'Twas a task beyond our means...
'Tis a harsh challenge, that.
Let's report this result to Ser Berne.
Tis a regrettable result... Still, best<cf>we told Ser Berne.
'Twas a certain victory.
We've mastered combat at close quarters.
Ser Berne is a formidable warrior.
A man of his experience will not lose so<cf>easily.
We'll train, then try again.
We lack the experience, yet.
He'll not allow us to win every challenge.
Tis true the Arisen needs strength enough to slay<cf>any beast.
The Arisen's path is twofold: to hone the body,<cf>but also to temper the soul.
Worry not for his safety. We must give him all<cf>that we have!
Ser Berne will not afford us a moment's hesitation!
Twas an eye-opening experience... I should like<cf>another chance at it.
Honing our instincts here can only serve us in<cf>the field, Arisen.
We were bested... Let's look toward the next challenge,<cf>Master.
What do I know of the old writings? Less than I know of modern script, and I never even learned me letters!
Alas, I'm a man of the sword, not the quill. Ask a scrivener. Or a counterfeiter, else.

I'm trying to keep focus. A fellow has to stay ready...
Uh...
Uugh.
Waaaaugh...
Hoh!
Haugh!
Aye, what?
Done with me, aye?
Aye.
No...
Ah, thanks.
...You're very kind.
So...hungry...
So what if the dragon comes tomorrow? Hunger's here today!
I reckon a dragon would eat you in one bite. That is a mite faster than your stomach gnawing on itself from the inside.
It hurts when your stomach gets too empty, so you eat. Meals and the long stretches between is what life is all about.
If we eat to live, but have no food, how is that livin' at all?
Each night I figure the Maker'll take me in my sleep, but each dawn I awake to find Him laughin'...
Last night I dreamt of a feast with all manner of meat and ale. Awake, even one whiff would do...
What, I am getting on your nerves with the whole hungry thing? I am a pauper, what else you think I have to talk about!?
Okay, how 'bout we switch -- I will go play around at Arisening, and you lay here and starve in the street.
So half the city falls into nothing and somehow I am still here. How is that for a half-baked doomsday?
Baked...urgh, damn it all. I am hungry!
...You're very kind.
Keep your distance, filth.
You've no place here.
Aanh?
I've no use for you.
Why are you here?
Don't get cocky, you.
Scared, are you?
Be off with you.
Hoy there. You look eager.
To living easy, aye?
Perhaps the Dragonforged knows<cf>aught of this...
Best we spoke to the Dragonforged.
The Dragonforged awaits atop<cf>Hillfigure Knoll.
The Tainted Mountain lies beyond the<cf>Greatwall.
I feel a strange presence beyond the<cf>door...
What will you choose...?
'Tis your choice...
Have you decided, then? To fight...?
The dragon's guard is down.<cf>If we strike now...
You would let them die...?
Are you certain, Master...?
You've bought honor, and peace<cf>besides... 'Tis a worthy bargain.
You were meant to lead this realm. I<cf>know it for true.
Keep still and you'll have taken the<cf>wyrm's bargain.
Follow the wyrm or return to the<cf>Dragonforged, the choice is yours.
The Dragonforged may have aught to<cf>say of this, Arisen.
If this path leads to the dragon's<cf>roost, we'd best be careful indeed.
'Tis well treacherous, but I fear we've<cf>no other paths before us.
'Tis dark ahead. Best we carried a<cf>lantern.
The dragon awaits just beyond.<cf>Best we steeled ourselves now.
I know not which is right...
I fear I have no words, Master...
It ends here, Arisen! I am at your side!
We're near upon the dragon's roost.<cf>'Tis time to cast aside all doubt.
Face the dragon, or return to the<cf>Dragonforged... 'Tis up to you, Arisen.
There's a way up here.
Heh heh... Keh heh ha ha ha ha! What garden<cf>of strange delights is this?
What forgotten paradise? What font of endless diversion?!
The darkness! The stench of blood! We<cf>stand at the merry mouth of hell itself!
Leave this place! You've still the time to<cf>turn back... Still the time to live...
I can bear to see no more death...
Call me craven if you will. I'll go no further.<cf>I grow so very tired...
My beloved... I had hoped to leave this life<cf>held in your strong arms... Farewell.
Ugh.
Guh!
Hnnngh...
Hup!
Rragh!
Faring well, ser?
Take care.
Aye, that's right.
I don't reckon so.
Sorry for the trouble.
Well, that's quite kind. Thank you, ser.
Most of Gran Soren's wealthiest have already left.
Gardener's work is the first to dry up in times of trouble, and that's well enough...
But it grieves me dearly to watch the gardens dry up with it.
With the dragon come, there's not a man in the city cares about the state of his garden.
For all their beauty, flowers are poor defense against the beast, I'll grant.
These days, a man's coin goes all to steel and provisions.
I get to thinking, times like these -- what aim does a man's life serve?
If we truly lived for living's sake alone, what call is there for flowers?
Why are we drawn to beauty, even in the face of doom?
Alas, I have a head for flowers, not for pond'ring such lofty concerns.
I thank the Maker I wasn't in the residential quarter...
There's a beauty to a well-tended garden, sure enough.
Beauty is a fickle thing, depending who you ask.
Take me, for one. For all its terror, I see a beauty in the dragon.
For a beast so large, it has a... Hmm.
There's an order to its form. A balance, if you like; a rival to any man's garden.
Have you seen the dragon for yourself, then?
What was your sense of it? While many only see bane in the dragon, others see its beauty.
There are those that say the dragon's is a perfect beauty...
Complete peace, found in the complete stillness what follows complete destruction.
Salvation, was it? Aye, that was the name.
Could be the dragon finds beauty in destruction. Or in its wake, at least.
We humans see the city swallowed up by the earth and we're filled with fear.
Could be the sight's as fair as a blooming rose to a dragon's eye.
Well, that's quite kind. Thank you, ser.
'Tis locked. You haven't the key to fit it...
'Tis caught on something. Perhaps it could open from the far side.
'Tis barred shut. Might be able to break the bolt.
'Tis shut tight.
'Tis no use at this hour. You'll have to come again later.
Best stop for now.
Seems they're closed.
Someone was here...
Lost them...
Gone...
Perhaps you've upset them.
There's naught to do here.
Best you moved on.
Not here...
The door is closed.
Shows no sign of opening.
There's aught there...
You don't see anything.
That smell...
Someone's near...
What's this...?
Fine view from here.
There's aught written here...
Must be a way to find something...
Smells delicious.
Perfect spot to place something.
You can almost reach...
There appears to be aught ahead.
That fall could kill.
'Tis dangerous to touch.
A strong blow might break it.
Perhaps if you came by night.
Perhaps if you came by day.
Perhaps if you came at dawn.
Perhaps if you came at dusk.
There's aught buried here...
You see no way up.
'Tis slick, this spot.
No use pressing any further.
No need to double back further.
No time for that now.
You cannot carry any more.
There may yet be aught lying about.
Seems there's naught you can take on at present.<cf>Best to try again later.
Perhaps with a bit of help...
Best you kept your weapon sheathed.
Is someone here...?
'Tis a place for tall folk.
'Tis a place for small folk.
Had you a woman in your band...
Had you a man in your band...
Had you a strong companion...
Had you a swift companion...
Had you a magick user...
Had you an apt climber...
Had you a skilled jumper...
This weapon will not help you.
That armor won't protect you.
You're ill equipped for this.
Seems it can't be used now.
You'll get no further use from it.
'Tis useless, now.
Hmm, not with your current equipment...
Not with your current party...
You hear aught from further in.
Enemies... They're close.
Best you got some rest.
You can carry no more!
You're too exhausted!
"Danger! Keep Out!"
"No Trespassing"
A sign.
Had you an Empty Flask, you might fill it here.
You'll get no further without a lantern.
'Tis dangerous to fumble about in the dark. Best find a light.
Best not just leave them.
If aught were left here, it would rot.
Best take care you don't get lost.
Best check the map.
You're due for a rest.
This place is dangerous by night.
This place is dangerous by day.
Breathtaking...
You'll get no further!
Seems you'll need to come back.
Nothing left here.
It looks fit to crumble.
Seems it could be moved...
It will not budge.
It will not open.
Seems you need a key.
Seems you need a Pickaxe here.
You yet lack the experience.
You yet lack the skill.
Not with your current vocation...
You'll not pass through this gate.
You've no time!
Seems you were too late.
You may make it, yet.
You're doing well for time.
Seems you've come at the wrong time.
There may be another path.
'Tis a powerful weapon... Too bad it doesn't work.
Invalid Message
A broken riftstone. Looks like you might be<cf>able to restore it by using rift crystals.
Restore the riftstone?<cf>Current rift crystals: <RIMS><cf>Rift crystal cost: <RIM2>
You haven't enough rift crystals to restore it.
Yes
No
Something strong can be sensed from the stone. It <cf>appears the memories of someone have been etched<cf>upon the surface of the Monument of Remembrance.
Locked, and by a special key. Seems you need<cf>a Void Key to open it.
Come, then, show yourself if you dare!
How fare you? Any injured!?
A...venge me...
'Tis beyond the hands of man...
Hand over anything of worth you've got!
Please, ser. I have a job to do.
Fare well.

...My, my.
Apologies, dear warrior.
But to see a face austere as the castle walls<cf>adorned with...this.
Still, 'tis more agreeable than the endlessly<cf>dour air of most of my husband's sworn swords.
Valor dwells in the heart, after all.
The brave ought not need their raiment<cf>to speak for their mettle, no?
We're like as blind in such darkness.
The castle dungeons may hold some clue.
I recall a spot we may rest not far<cf>from here.
'Tis Reynard's father's diary.
There! A riftstone!
Reynard has waited all his life for word of<cf>his father. 'Tis cruel to keep him waiting.
Mind the edge, Master!
A fall here means certain death!
'Tis slow going through the marshes.
Careful, ser. The marshes hamper<cf>our movement.
This fog has us blind...
There may be aught lurking within.<cf>Be ready.
Let us be off!
Whither shall we go?
Stay vigilant.
How strange...
Stay away from the deep water!
Hmm, seems as though there's a<cf>space beyond the wall.
Mayhap it needs a key?
They are many!
I've a bad feeling... Arms at the ready!
Seems a page torn from a diary, master.
Here, Arisen -- 'tis another way.
You can judge the suitability of your<cf>party based on that information.
This writing... A journal page, perhaps?
Is there someone we need speak with?
The animals of the field are a good source<cf>of meat.
Many plants grow in the shade of tall trees<cf>or in dense woods.
We'll find as much growing atop a tree as<cf>we will at its roots.
We'll need special tools to harvest ore<cf>from the earth.
Careless running can leave a fellow out of<cf>breath and vulnerable.
Many a life was ended by falling from too<cf>great a height.
There's merit in felling birds from the sky.
Have we sufficient curatives?
Too many possessions can be more a hindrance<cf>than a help.
Keep vigilant. 'Tis always best we see our<cf>foes ere they see us.
Listen well, for few are the monsters that<cf>keep silent.
Lucky is the pawn able to fight at the<cf>Arisen's side. I am thankful.
'Tis my duty to share this journey with you,<cf>and an honor besides.
Mm? Did you say something, Arisen?
How may I serve you?
Forgive me if I am not always able to hear<cf>you, Master.
I fear I've naught to say, Arisen.
'Tis not defeat to flee from battle, Master.<cf>'Tis survival.
Best we brought cures for various ailments.<cf>They may save our lives.
The shadows oft hold monsters.
Pawns who have expended the last of their<cf>health must be hired anew.
High elevations make fine watchtowers. Best<cf>we sighted threats at a distance.
If you're tired, rest.
If you lose your way, you need but consult<cf>your map.
A well-formed party can often fell even foes<cf>stronger than they.
Combat needn't be grueling, Arisen. If the<cf>party needs adjusting, adjust it.
Be wary of lights in the darkness. Goblins<cf>oft bear torches.
Man claims the sea is mother to all life...<cf>This pawn sees only water.
Stay wary at the water's edge, lest you attract<cf>the Brine. It will not stop until you are fully<cf>consumed.
If we're to journey far afield, we'd best be<cf>well prepared.
We'll have a view of the capital once we've<cf>gained the pass.
My kind grows better able to serve the more<cf>we learn.
Keep watch on your surroundings. They hold<cf>threats and treasures alike.
I fear some places hold too great a danger<cf>for my kind to join you.
When venturing into new territory, best you<cf>went by daylight.
The roads are comparatively safe and free of<cf>monsters.
If we catch foes unawares, the first strike<cf>is ours to take.
You'll suffer greater damage if struck without<cf>your weapon drawn.
Crates may hold aught of use.
Gransys is overrun with brigands. Stay wary,<cf>even on the roads.
A one-eyed giant lurks outside.
I hear tell a massive winged monster's been<cf>seen to attack humans.
If you aim to gather materials, best you<cf>searched by day.
This road is frequented by peddlers.
Goblins roam in packs, Arisen.
This stretch is home to wolves. Take care<cf>they don't surround us.
Wolves are loath to let go once they bite.<cf>Shake them as soon as you can.
A large encampment stands nearby.
We're not far from the Mountain Waycastle.
There's talk of an old cave near here.
This stretch of road is called the Manamia Trail.
Monsters are fewer near the capital.
Monsters grow bold by night.
A place safe in the afternoon sun may not be<cf>so after dark.
Lanterns are a necessity by night.
Even the roads are unsafe by night. Doubly so<cf>without a lantern.
Be cautious, Master. The dark holds many a surprise.
Quiet night...
The insects' song only serves to underscore<cf>the silence.
Some materials can only be found by night,<cf>should you wish to seek them.
'Tis unwise, this business of walking about<cf>by night.
A dying lantern oft dooms its bearer to<cf>follow. Carry ample oil.
This place is bedeviled by the undead.
What is it leaves a land so desolate, I wonder...
The smell of death hangs heavy here.
'Tis a place barren of life.
I daresay we'll gain little here.
An ancient spire stands atop the cape. The<cf>Bluemoon Tower.
Watch your step, Master. 'Tis an unkind fall...
'Tis well old, this place. Who built it,<cf>and for what purpose?
The remnants of this tower stand now a<cf>tombstone to a bygone age.
Look closely at the tops of walls and similar spots.<cf>There may be places we can climb.
This place has many names, but the Witchwood<cf>is that most oft heard.
Visibility is poor. We'll have little<cf>forewarning should monsters strike.
I'd wager few enter these woods. Who knows<cf>what rarities we'll find?
Do not stray from the path, lest we be lost<cf>in this wood forever...
Keep your eyes sharp, Arisen. We may find<cf>paths in unexpected places.
'Twould not surprise me to learn a wood<cf>of this sort truly held a witch.
The woods are even less hospitable by night...
Just now -- aught in the shadows...
I feel it nearby, but cannot see it... 'Tis<cf>unnerving...
'Tis dark as blackest ink, this wood.
We'd fare far better in daylight.
'Tis a rough-hewn place, and bare.
Strongholds needn't be pretty, only sturdy.
For what purpose was this place built?
I suspect we'll gain little here.
Going north through this pass leads to Gran Soren.
The wyrm's coming has not broken the<cf>villagers' spirits.
Let's prepare well for the road ahead.
The road runs straight from Cassardis to the<cf>encampment.
The village shops will have weapons and<cf>supplies both.
We can rest till day or night. Simply leave<cf>word with the innkeep.
The inn's seats offer a place for my kind to<cf>speak and receive guidance.
Conversation is the heart of any bond. In<cf>time, it can foster great affinity.
The villagers take to their homes by night.<cf>Best speak to them by day.
There are pawns about as well. Speak to any<cf>you would enlist to the party.
We'll find weapons and curatives for the road<cf>here in the village.
Strong folk, these. They weathered the wyrm's<cf>coming like a squall at sea.
It seems recent events weigh heavily upon<cf>some of the villagers...
Are you tired, Master? Do not hesitate to seek<cf>an inn and rest.
Chief Adaro will no doubt have wise council,<cf>should you have need of it.
Do not antagonize the villagers, lest they<cf>lose their trust in you.
'Tis a fine chapel. Those in the graves<cf>beside it like rest well.
The shore is lovely, but best avoid the<cf>water's edge lest you meet the Brine.
'Tis quiet. The village lies asleep.
'Tis dangerous to wander about by night.
If we aim to walk about, we'd best bring a<cf>lantern.
'Tis of a scale fit to dwarf Cassardis.
The capital is home to a Pawn Guild where<cf>my kind gathers.
My kind are not permitted within the castle.<cf>I shall await you here.
There are troubled folk here as well. Perhaps<cf>you might speak with them.
Speak to these people, and in time you'll<cf>build a bond of trust.
'Tis quite the intricate maze of passages.<cf>I fear I'll soon be lost.
The peoples' calm belies the mounting flood<cf>of monsters at their gates...
Do mind your behavior inside, Master. A<cf>slight might see you arrested.
A grand cathedral, fit for a grand city.
The rift represents the bond 'tween pawn and<cf>Arisen. Do take full advantage.
The capital even holds a barber's shop.
Gran Soren boasts an impressive array of<cf>shops, truly.
We'll have little trouble procuring<cf>equipment and supplies here.
Be sure we carry an ample store of oil<cf>to keep the lantern burning.
'Tis dark and unsettling, this place.
That smell... I haven't the words.
I'll ill miss this dank place when we move on...
Such narrow halls ill suit combat...
Am I alone in wishing to be out of this place?
'Tis a tangled knot of paths inside. Best<cf>we prepared well.
The stench of beast only grows as we press<cf>deeper in.
'Tis a place for the dead, yet I feel eyes<cf>upon me.
To judge from the smell, the air has lain<cf>still as long as the dead.
'Tis a fount of undead creatures...
Those who've fallen here soon rise again...
Many an age has passed since this place<cf>served as an altar.
Water seeps from every corner...
It must be welling up from a spring or the like...
Seems a likely spot for some grand contraption.
The structure lives up to its name.
Holes dot the ground here...
A single mislaid step, and you needn't<cf>worry about the next...
Mind your footing, even in battle.
'Tis madness, this height...
I sense a...strange power. It seems somehow familiar...
This place sees little traffic.
It seems a special place. A forgotten one.
There's aught over here.
'Tis this way, Arisen.
This direction, Master.
What... What is this place?
This feeling... An archydra, Master.<cf>'Tis near.
An archydra lurks beyond...<cf>Be watchful.
They are confused...<cf>Lost without their masters.
'Tis the fate of all pawns who lose<cf>their masters.
They wander still, bereaved.
This place feels like no other I've<cf>known... Stay vigilant, Arisen.
Are we truly trapped here? Left to<cf>wander for all time...
Be watchful for the fiends what haunt these halls.
Looks like part of a journal... I wonder<cf>whose?
Another page torn from a journal...
I wonder what's become of the author?
More journal entries, written in the same<cf>hand...
Whoever wrote these harbored quite the<cf>wanderlust.
We've amassed quite a collection of these<cf>journal entries.
The journal entries we've found form a<cf>narrative. Seems we have them all.
Look here! The name, signed to the<cf>journal's final page!
Is that not the name of Reynard's father?
It's Reynard's father!
Do you suppose we might find what<cf>Reynard seeks?
Reynard's father was here, once...
Perhaps we'll find aught of Reynard's<cf>father in Gran Soren as well.
'Tis a likely place to find some trace of<cf>Reynard's father.
Rockslide!
Do not get trapped!
Purchasing equipment here in Cassardis will<cf>make for a safer trip to the encampment.
'Twas a long road we walked, and yet come<cf>to an end so soon... I'll ne'er forget it.
Still, I ill like the look of that sky. To look<cf>upon the villagers, I see I am not alone in that.
I am worried for the capital, Arisen. Perhaps we had best return?
'Tis dark news, to be sure, but it must be heard.
'Tis a grave shame. I pray this is the last that such a thing happens.
We've done as asked. Best we advised Elvar of it.
Let us send Cortese off with our prayers as well.
Cortese's grave stands by the chapel. Perhaps we've time to pay our respects.
I'm sure they will have searched the immediate area already...
Let's have a look outside the church. Perhaps someone knows aught.
Shall we report in?
Of all the places to find that book... In any case, the father awaits.
I'd wager other out-of-the-way spots hide such items. ...For now, let's return to Clemente.
Mission complete.
'Tis a grand thing to be of help to others.
He seemed well relieved to have the scriptures back.
Let's continue our search beyond the village. Just stay watchful for monsters.
A great relief, to know the injured are mending.
'Tis a joy to think our actions have eased the pain of others.
Seems we were too late... A grave shame.
We'll need a source of light within the well.
The dark is home to many a monster.<cf>Stay ready, Master.
The beasts in the well are weak to ice.
'Twas a difficult task...
We cannot suffer this thief to go free<cf>any longer. Let's speak with the others.
Best we speak with the victims, agreed?
'Tis a kind breeze.
'Tis a welcome breeze...
That was surprisingly simple.
I warrant we'll have no further trouble from<cf>that one. Let's speak to Pablos.
Escaped by a hair's breadth... I am sorry,<cf>Arisen.
The thief has won another day's freedom.<cf>Next he comes, though, he'll not escape!
It certainly was a strange request.
The thief is caught. In the end, that's all<cf>that matters.
Seems our thief is eager to mend his ways.<cf>Perhaps there's aught we may do to ensure it.
I worry for the boy, given the rigid temper<cf>of bandit clans.
The boy's resolve was firm, but...<cf>Perhaps we might go and see how he's fared?
If the text is Wyrmspeak, the<cf>Dragonforged can like decipher it.
The Dragonforged resides atop Hillfigure<cf>Knoll.
'Twas a happy outcome. Let us return to<cf>Quina.
'Tis the fruit of Quina's diligence. Come, she'll be<cf>eager to hear the news.
Gardener to the duke... Then we'd best return<cf>to Gran Soren.
We've need of information, first, and this is<cf>not likely the place we'll find it...
This pawn is worried for Quina...
Where is this Witchwood? We may find a guide.
The Witchwood? 'Tis well removed from here.<cf>Allow me to guide you.
The chief was put at ease.
That lays the matter to rest.<cf>Shall we make for the encampment?
'Tis not far from here to the encampment.<cf>The girl will be fine.
'Tis but a short walk, but we mustn't grow complacent.
When do you suppose Valmiro went missing?
He's an outgoing sort. He'll like have friends<cf>among the villagers and peddlers we might ask.
'Tis a burden I am glad to be quit of.
At times, such heedless drive is a rare and precious<cf>thing... At times.
Gathering a fellow's supplies is simple<cf>enough.
He'll be needing potent curatives.<cf>Best we fetch him a number of them.
Lanterns are easily procured.<cf>Let's gather as many as he has need.
Near any food will serve... Is there aught he'd prefer<cf>for provisions?
'Tis said meat is finest just afore it rots.<cf>...Harder to procure, as well.
Aught to wish him safe travels... A charm, perhaps?
I recall charms and wards in Gran Soren's shops.<cf>And in the catacombs...
The crates upon the shore must be his freight.
I suspect we're to carry those wooden crates by the<cf>sea.
'Tis a man with his own unique aims...
For all his eccentricities, there is aught about<cf>him that draws others in...
'Twill be slow going, just us two.
We've need of numbers.<cf>Let's ask the other pawns' help.
This seems a task for raw muscle.
A Fighter would make short work of<cf>them.
These scarecrows demand more than<cf>brute force.
'Tis a task fit for a mage.
You may now hire pawns at any time.
We'd best keep our party full.<cf>No harm in being prepared.
'Twas a fierce battle... What were the<cf>damages?
'Tis quiet again, at least. We'd best<cf>speak to Ser Mercedes.
Shall we hire a pawn more knowledgeable?
Flying monsters plague the path to<cf>Gran Soren.
We must protect the ox at all costs!
Sturdy as she is, I've my doubts she needs<cf>an escort at all.
Perhaps we'll have occasion to meet her again,<cf>in Gran Soren.
Unfortunately, I know nothing.
This place is a den to all manner of beast. Best we enter prepared.
We know not what lies inside.<cf>Let's be prepared.
I've heard the Watergod's Altar -- the ruins<cf>behind the falls -- are overrun with saurians.
We'll need to explore the ruins anew<cf>to learn more of these tablets.
I do not know what lies ahead, but let's take<cf>no more than the bare essentials.
They're well heavy. Best we went<cf>in light as we can manage.
Let us report our progress to the capital.
That ends our task.<cf>Shall we to Gran Soren?
Now, to Gran Soren to deliver our<cf>report.
The hunt is on. What stratagem do you<cf>suppose the duke's men will employ?
We're to lure the griffin aground, then<cf>strike. Let's follow Ser Georg's lead.
We've no time to be crestfallen. Come,<cf>Ser Georg is formulating our next move.
'Tis wounded! We'll pursue it to the Bluemoon<cf>Tower and be done with it for good and all! 
Seems this place is home to goblins.
Sounds of a conflict within the hold,<cf>Arisen.
The men of the hold revolt! We must<cf>get inside!
The hold is quiet once more. Best we<cf>returned to the capital, Arisen.
The uprising is quashed. We must tell<cf>Ser Aldous of what's happened.
We were rushed from the capital, now they bid<cf>us return? What is the meaning of this? 
I fear trouble awaits us within the capital,<cf>Arisen. Best we went prepared for anything. 
I fear we'll need to leave the village if we want more.
Whichever you choose, blood will run...
Let us leave the bandits for the moment and<cf>ask after this traitor in the village.
We've honored the condition we were issued.
'Tis unfortunate our hands were sullied in a<cf>thieves' war... For now, let us return to Maul.
'Tis a relief to see that he was spared.
We've formed a bond, and at no cost to<cf>human life. 'Tis a fine thing indeed.
'Twas an onerous task. I am glad it bore fruit,<cf>however strange.
We've proven ourselves allies to the Iron Hammer.<cf>We'll surely reap the dividends in times to come.
The rival bandits' stronghold lies far to<cf>the south.
There can be no harm in speaking with these<cf>women afore we...do what we must.
It seems they've troubles of their own.
A pet cyclops... Imagine. Still, I suppose<cf>there's naught to be lost in helping?
...I confess, I'd not fully believed the<cf>talk of a pet cyclops. Yet there it is.
The creature eats, and happily! Let's bring<cf>word of this to that woman thief.
She seemed well glad to hear it.
'Twas the most harrowing act of feeding<cf>I've yet performed... Let's report back.
Bandits or no, I do not relish the thought of<cf>needless bloodshed.
I fear we are a part of this feud, now.<cf>For the moment, let's bring word back west.
Tending to the cyclops has earned us her<cf>trust. Truly, a most...unique experience.
I'd never have imagined we could seal a bond<cf>with bandits through such a simple task.
'Twas an onerous task. I am glad it bore<cf>fruit, however strange.
We've proven ourselves allies to the sisters of<cf>the Westron Labrys. We'll reap the dividends<cf>in days to come.
Tis simple courier work, Arisen.<cf>Let's make for Gran Soren.
We're to deliver Ser Daerio's request for supplies<cf>to one of the castle guard, or Lord Julien himself.
I cannot help but feel we've been used somehow...
It seems this Night's Champion has some<cf>connection to Salvation. 'Tis worrisome.
With the confusion brought by the dragon,<cf>'twould be an easy task to enter the city as<cf>part of some foreign entourage.
That narrows our search. Let's make for the<cf>south.
The Iron Hammer dwells within a hold near<cf>the southern shore.
The grimoire is ours. Let's return to Gran<cf>Soren.
Tis a shame to part with such a rarity. If<cf>only we had two copies... No, forgive me.
I've no help to give you.
Open a gate? 'Tis a simple enough feat.
The quarry has near as many tricks and devices as ore.<cf>Best we see for ourselves.
There are ogres in these caves. Bring plenty of<cf>curatives.
Slaying monsters is our domain, Arisen.
A grand cave, home to grand monsters. Best we kept our<cf>guards up, Master.
Now that this place is safe, it'll serve as a shortcut<cf>linking south and central Gransys.
The cave is rid of pests and fit for human<cf>use. A grand victory, Arisen.
If it's a priest we seek, let's make for a church.
Churches stand in Cassardis and Gran Soren both,<cf>each with a priest to match.
Perhaps someone in the church might advise us on<cf>whom to give the flower.
Some member of the Faith might best judge<cf>Quina's ability. A priest, perhaps?
We need but speak to Quina for another<cf>blessed flower.
She may see the Grand Cathedral ere long. 'Til then,<cf>we can spread her flowers to others.
What does this mean, Arisen?<cf>Who would wish you dead?
'Tis the work of one who wishes you dead,<cf>Arisen. We'd best stay vigilant.
Somehow we've muddled through...
If that was truly the last of the cutthroats,<cf>we've at last earned peace of mind.
I pray he was the last in truth. We cannot<cf>allow their ilk to stay us in our quest.
That beast... It carries aught with it...
Is that the creature what stole the<cf>pack? Strike it down and see!
To make this charm, best we looked someplace<cf>with old things lying about.
Now, where were they selling charms? Gran<cf>Soren? No, 'twas in the catacombs. ...Right?
We can but pray for her safe travels now.
Quina would ne'er had the resolve to make this<cf>trip without your encouragement, Arisen.
Whate'er else has passed, at least<cf>Madeleine is safe and well.
Aye, 'tis a shame, but she's the sort to<cf>flourish where'er she goes.
All are safe... 'Twas a close thing.
Lady Aelinore is free again. We can but hope she finds<cf>good fortune in the road ahead.
We've failed... Lady Aelinore...is dead...
I'd sleep easier knowing he'd returned to Cassardis,<cf>but I fear the chance of that is slim...
I hope we'll not need repeat this at the encampment...<cf>Just the same, we'd best have a look.
Next is the Witchwood, is it? No doubt we'll find him<cf>in dire straits, as ever...
'Tis no mean feat to find word of Reynard's father<cf>with naught to go by.
Perhaps there's aught with ties to his father<cf>among the items we've gathered...
Do you suppose we'll see Reynard again?
'Twas a sad parting, but I am cheered to have<cf>furnished him with a memento.
We've made it.
Shall we head in?
Perchance one of these people knows<cf>aught of the Pawn Guild.
There's a woman called Sara who may<cf>know something.
I've no knowledge of this matter.
Seems the Pawn Guild lies in the<cf>western part of town.
The city's west side lies beyond the<cf>gate to our right once we depart.
Good, we've found it.
Looks as though Barnaby has more to<cf>say.
What manner of place is this Everfall?
We'll have need of a lantern in the<cf>Everfall.
Flame and holy magicks are effective against<cf>the monsters of the Everfall.
'Twas a terror I'll not soon forget...
We're done and back alive -- I'm<cf>glad of both.
We'd best find someone who knows of<cf>that slate.
Mayhap someone who trades in works<cf>of art would know something?
I've no advice to give.
Perhaps a maker of forgeries would<cf>know something about that slate.
The Black Cat is located in the Venery.
A courier... Have you seen one?
I believe I've seen a courier taking a break<cf>from his rounds near the Fountain Square.
Let us hire a pawn with knowledge of our<cf>current task.
Perhaps we'd best bring a pawn who's<cf>been to Hillfigure Knoll.
'Tis a long road ahead. Let's make<cf>ample preparations.
'Twas a grueling task. Will you take a rest?
'Tis a fair walk to the Stone of the Southwest.<cf>Best hire on one who knows the road.
'Tis fastest to cut through the<cf>quarry, Master.
This shall surely be a grueling battle. Prepare<cf>as many curatives as possible.
Let's hear what the city folk know.
The one named Meridith has a good<cf>ear for information.
Mason... The name is familiar.<cf>Let's find him.
I believe Mason lives in these slums.
That badge may loosen the tongues of<cf>Salvation members.
I suspect Sairus knows something.<cf>That badge may win his confidence.
Mason or Maximilian would like know<cf>of the catacombs.
'Twould be a help to have along a pawn<cf>familiar with the catacombs.
The crypts lie beyond the river at<cf>Gran Soren's northwest.
Things have turned out well.
No doubt we'll find our priest at the<cf>cathedral.
That tall, slim building is the<cf>cathedral.
Ruins cloaked by a waterfall... We<cf>could well use a guide.
This pawn can lead you to the ruins<cf>behind the falls.
The duke has finally taken notice<cf>of your feats, Master.
The castle awaits you, just through<cf>that portcullis, Master.
Duke Edmun is a famed hero who drove away<cf>a dragon of his own. This audience is proof of<cf>his cooperation.
Congratulations, Master. Shall we<cf>pay Ser Aldous a visit, then?
Representatives from lands sworn to aid<cf>against the dragon will be gathered in the<cf>audience chamber.
Ser Mercedes, acting captain of the Enlistment<cf>Corps, has also come from abroad.
Someone in the castle must know of this.
To steal a treasure of the duchy? 'Twould be<cf>nigh-impossible for one without connection to<cf>the inside.
Shall we next speak with the townspeople?
Someone must know of this Salomet.
We'd be wise to find a guide to see<cf>us to the quarry, Master.
Allow me to guide you to the quarry, Arisen.<cf>We'll leave as soon as your preparations are made.
I know only that the Bluemoon Tower lies far to<cf>the north... We'd best hire a guide.
Pack well, for the Bluemoon Tower is many<cf>leagues' travel. I shall serve as guide. 
If we're to join in the hunt, we ought<cf>hasten to meet the others outside the capital.
Griffins have no love of fire. Best we<cf>ready some afore we join the others.
Somehow, we completed our mission.
'Twas a fearsome foe... But our task is done.
We cannot aid Ser Mercedes until we<cf>find her, Arisen.
Ser Mercedes may yet be within the<cf>capital somewhere.
How do we get there?
We'd do well to bring a pawn who<cf>knows the way to serve as guide.
The Stone of the North is not so far<cf>from the capital. I'll guide you.
Something strange is afoot, to see the<cf>castle barred to you, Arisen.
It seems quite urgent, whatever it is. Come,<cf>this pawn will lead you to the waycastle.
We must slay the cockatrice before all else!
Protect the duke's tribute and<cf>slay the beast!
'Twas stopped afore reaching the<cf>residential quarter at least...
'Tis fastest to seek proof here in the<cf>capital, like as not.
Seems there are those willing to<cf>testify for either side.
I recall talk of Fournival in Cassardis,<cf>and the Stone of the North...
That peddler by the encampment,<cf>Reynard -- he knew aught of Fournival.
Why not ask Jasper's family their opinion on<cf>Fournival?
The judge will soon hand down his ruling. We'd<cf>best hurry to the capital's Fountain Square.
I hear the Greatwall is a far distance. We'd do well to bring a guide.
If it's the Greatwall you seek,<cf>prepare well. I shall guide you there.
'Tis good we were able to please Caxton.
Would that all of our endeavors went so smoothly.
Might you know of any shops that deal in<cf>such things, Arisen?
We might begin by asking around among the<cf>city's vendors.
Bandits... But they can be found all over<cf>Gransys.
The Iron Hammer bandits are known to deal<cf>in grimoires and other curiosities.
We've done as asked. Let us be glad of that.
'Twas a tome of considerable power.<cf>He must be well satisfied to have it.
I've heard talk that Wakestones can be found<cf>in the Everfall.
It seems our work here is done.<cf>Good work, Master.
The dead breathe once more... 'Tis a queer<cf>sight.
I daresay we'll have use for such a power in<cf>our journeys to come.
We'd best speak with the girl first.
I fear a day spent with her will prove long indeed.
Vexing girl... Where is she hidden?
Best we find her afore she grows tired of hiding.
Where has Symone run off to? The guild?
We'll need a bottle of some sort if we're to<cf>fetch water.
Had we a bottle, the water is simple enough to find.<cf>Let's make haste.
We pawns can but obey, but...what of you, Arisen?
'Tis probably in your favor to let her win...
Did our efforts serve any real purpose, do you think?
Some day we've had... Still, she seemed pleased, and<cf>I'm not sad to see a day without blood spilt.
You're to meet with this Fedel on the castle<cf>grounds at night, are you not?
If your meeting is in the deep of night, best to<cf>wait in the castle gardens.
'Tis a long journey to reach the Greatwall,<cf>Master. We'll reach it faster with a guide.
This pawn knows well the canyon near the<cf>Greatwall, Arisen. I am happy to guide you.
I ill like this place, Arisen...
It seems these secret meetings take place<cf>within the capital.
Most like these meetings happen in some<cf>forgotten corner of the city.
Now we've the key, we need only find the lock...
That key's lock lies in the catacombs. If you would<cf>go there, I can guide you.
Salvation oft employs monsters to work its evil. Best<cf>we were prepared.
Excellent work, Master. 'Tis a good thing we managed<cf>to stop the danger afore it could spread.
With luck, this will quiet Salvation a while.
The castle may be entered from the dungeons.
Arisen... If you infiltrate the dungeons,<cf>do try to avoid excessive capture.
'Tis a reunion hard won, but I am glad to see<cf>it just the same.
They'll not soon forget your hand in rejoining<cf>them, Arisen.
I'm glad to see we've met Madeleine's expectations.
We'll find those Fournival would evict<cf>somewhere in the capital. 
We'll find Jasper giving speeches in the<cf>capital's streets.
The eviction has succeeded. We'd best report<cf>to Fournival.
The family has been successfully removed.<cf>Well done, Arisen.
Certainly a queer request for an Arisen, yet it<cf>is completed nonetheless.
'Twas a just decision, Master.
Giving of yourself to save a family is truly an<cf>action worthy of an Arisen.
That was what the Mother Superior<cf>needed for Quina's gift, Arisen.
Talk of witch hunts has me worried for<cf>Selene... Let's seek a guide.
This pawn ill likes the sound of witch<cf>hunts. Allow me to guide you.
That dagger looks familiar... And where is Madeleine?
'Tis Madeleine's blade, make no mistake.<cf>Has something happened?
A request from the duchess... I do hope<cf>acceding to it is a good idea...
You've been through quite a trial, Arisen.<cf>I offer my deepest regrets.
'Tis a fair distance to the manse. We might benefit<cf>from a guide.
This pawn will see you to the manse. The duchess<cf>awaits; let's set out once you're ready.
The person Salvation is working through...<cf>Could it be the rumored Night's Champion?
Who is that Night's Champion?
We'd best be watchful if we're to determine a suspect.
Schemes breed in darkness and shadow. We'll watch<cf>who leaves the castle anights.
That one, just now... Quite suspicious, to my<cf>thinking...
That seemed quite curious to this pawn's eye. Let's<cf>pursue them!
We'd best bring word of this meeting to Mason...<cf>No, to the barkeep.
Intrigue sets the heart to racing... Er, forgive<cf>me, Arisen.
We've done our part. The rest falls to Mason and his<cf>accomplices.
The Night's Champion has insinuated himself<cf>into the court to send information to<cf>Salvation, most like.
I fear we've failed, Master...
Our task is done. To the capital.
Then, to the Tainted Mountain. 'Tis time to<cf>face the dragon once and for all.
'Tis a strange power emanates from that ring.
The Arisen's bond... Whoe'er you gift it to will forever<cf>be linked to you.
I have nothing to tell you now.
We'd best check the grounds to know what to<cf>do next.
The duke's men are inside!<cf>Let's lend them our steel!
The soldiers are inside the hold!<cf>Let's help the captain!
The duke's men are leaving. Best we<cf>returned with our report as well.
More of them, Master! Let's press on<cf>and put them to rout!
Their leader lurks at the rear of the<cf>hold. Let's put him to the blade!
The hold is ours, Arisen! Let's<cf>return with word of this.
We've retaken the hold! This place<cf>will know a new master, now.
'Tis the deciding moment.<cf>Let's wait and watch.
Master, have you heard of the Night's Champion?
Rumors fly that the Night's Champion is a<cf>Salvation spy that has infiltrated the court.
What connection does this Night's Champion<cf>have to Salvation? It is a mystery.
After the Elysion!
The Elysion flees!
For good or ill, we've done as asked.<cf>Let's return.
'Tis for you alone to decide, Arisen...
I fear I've no counsel to offer...
If you feel a foe is beyond our means, there<cf>is no shame in fleeing.
Just being at your side fills this pawn with<cf>vigor, Arisen.
That aught to resolve our skeleton woes. Let's<cf>return to the capital.
Seems Salvation's shadow stretches far and wide.<cf>Ser Maximilian must know of this.
He's fled, but we had best give word<cf>of our findings just the same.
'Tis not the last we've heard of Salomet, I'll<cf>warrant. Let's speak to Ser Aldous. 
The gate is open! Let's tell Alon.
The lock is released, Master. Let's return with word of<cf>the gate's opening.
We managed, somehow... The task is done.
The cave is gone quiet, Master. Let's return with word of<cf>our success.
Gransys is well to be rid of such a<cf>man. Let's return to the capital.
The ring is retrieved. Ser Aldous<cf>will be eager to have it back.
'Twas a costly battle, but the griffin poses a threat no longer. Let's return.
'Tis a loathsome beast, but I fear<cf>we've no choice!
Shall we explain everything to the<cf>Dragonforged? He ought to be able to set us<cf>on the right path.
Rather than rush off unprepared, best to<cf>ask one who has faced the dragon before.
Unable to choose, Master?
If you've made your choice, 'tis time<cf>to act.
They were more than I'd imagined... Still, victory is ours. Let's bring word of this to Poll.
The threat is quelled for today. With luck, 'tis the last we'll see of their kind here.
What? More fiends in the well?
The saurians have grown their numbers once more... 'Tis clear we must strike this threat at its root.
I pray that puts an end to the matter. For now, let's return.
This time, surely, they are eradicated for good and all. Come, let's bring word of this back.
The threat is quashed and the village made safe. Mayhap we've a future in extermination.
The capital...fallen! How?
Is this some final evil worked by the wyrm?<cf>I fear for the people of Castle Dragonsbane...
We must fly, Arisen! This way!
Those tentacles... What should we do!?
We cannot fight these tentacles.<cf>Run, Arisen!
I know no useful details.
Pieces of Wakestone... Where should we even<cf>begin to look?
These fragments hold the key to what<cf>lies beyond. I'm sure of it.
Gathering these may open<cf>a new way to us.
What do you suppose we'll find below?
We'll find the truth below...<cf>We must jump.
All creation is yours to command, to<cf>end or sustain as you will.
To prolong creation, or to end it.<cf>That choice is yours alone.
You've the means to bring about<cf>anything. Even the end...
With the Seneschal's end comes the<cf>end of all things... Is that it?
Tis an endless chain... A repetition<cf>without bound.
The letter is recovered!
Now to see it back safely. Let's make<cf>haste to Gran Soren.
Quite deep, this forest...
I know not what dwells in this wood.<cf>We must keep Quina safe.
Dangerous creatures make a home of this<cf>place. We must protect Quina.
Advance slowly where visibility is poor.<cf>'Twill give us time to react.
Our goal is met, though it took us quite a distance.
Quina's aims are fulfilled. She seems quite grateful,<cf>Arisen.
Looks like...a hole. What could be beyond?
A tunnel extends where the golem stood.<cf>Let's go find Selene.
'Tis quite the relief to know Selene is safe.
We need be distracted from our quest by<cf>fear for Selene no further. 
At last the man sees sense. I do hope his wanderlust<cf>is sated at long last.
Even he cannot be so reckless as to further put<cf>himself in harm's way. Let's tell Merin.
I recall seeing figurines near the home of<cf>the Dragonforged, and in the Witchwood...
I've seen an idol in Gran Soren that fits<cf>that description. A girl had it, as I recall...
We'd best prepare ourselves for<cf>whate'er is to come next, Arisen.
'Twas a worthy experience, and you'll<cf>have more of the duke's trust for it.
This pawn cannot enter the castle.<cf>I shall await you here.
They were dogged foes.
'Tis fortunate we stemmed the threat ere it reached the village.
Seems it won't open from this side.
'Tis held fast from the far side.
It looks a rotten billboard...
Seems something's written here.
This riftstone is shattered...
We'll have no use of the riftstone in this<cf>condition, Arisen.
That fire's glow is a welcome sight<cf>indeed.
An unlit beacon, Arisen.
Best we rested here.
The path ahead is long and hard. Let us<cf>rest while we can.
We had best face the trials ahead well<cf>prepared.
Shall we rest afore pressing on?
Best we repaired that riftstone as soon as<cf>we are able.
Repairing a riftstone bears a cost.
Access to the Rift is vital in the bowels of<cf>such a place.
Knowing a riftstone is close at hand is<cf>welcome relieve to a pawn.
This pawn feels most at ease near a<cf>riftstone.
'Tis a welcome surprise to find a<cf>riftstone in such a dire place...
Blessed relief. This riftstone will mend our<cf>wounds.
Let us continue our exploration using this<cf>stone as a hub.
'Tis the makings of a beacon fire, master.<cf>We need but offer up rift crystals to light it.
Let us light this fire, if just for the present.
A bit more light can only help us in our<cf>explorations.
Seems the blaze lasts for a while once lit.
A lantern serves well in the dark, but it<cf>cannot match a beacon fire's light.
We'd not be remiss to light this fire, ser.
The dark is our enemy, like as any beast. If<cf>we can banish it with this, let us do so.
We'll not fear for ambush if we dispel the<cf>dark with this.
The halls are narrow, and their twists and<cf>turns confounding. Let us be cautious.
Assume the enemy lurks 'round every<cf>corner.
Strain your eyes against the dark. We may<cf>not be alone.
Watch your footing, master. A fall can kill<cf>ready as any beast.
Stay vigilant--places unremarkable at a<cf>glance may hold more.
When jumping down a ledge, judge well the<cf>distance.
Our foes are fearsome strong. Best we made<cf>a point of treating any wounds immediately.
Even the same path can offer different views<cf>'tween coming and going.
Be mindful of your pawns' health, in combat<cf>and in transit both.
'Tis possible to fall prey to an ailment<cf>without ever noticing. Stay vigilant.
The choice to flee is one best made early.
Let us be doubly sure to collect any spoils<cf>left after a fight.
We'd be well served to keep a constant store<cf>of curatives, however small.
Hoarding treasures will not keep us alive.<cf>Let us put any spoils toward honing our arms.
Some materials can be found nowhere save<cf>here.
If aught we've collected is cursed, we'll need<cf>to see the spell undone first.
We'll know the nature of an item once it's<cf>been uncursed.
We'll have need of the best arms available if<cf>we hope to survive this place.
It seems just wearing some equipment can<cf>improve one's skills.
Some scrolls pass knowledge of new skills<cf>simply by collecting them.
The surface lies beyond.
Through this door lies a path to the surface.
Shall we make for the surface? We'll not be<cf>able to return straight away, but...
Let us be well sure afore deciding to return.
Return now, and we'll not be able to come back<cf>immediately.
I fear this is a one-way path. If we take it,<cf>we'll not easily return.
Some of the spoils we find here bear curses.
Something feels...off about that object,<cf>Arisen.
Hmm, an item of uncertain nature... What<cf>ought we do with it?
This object... 'Tis cursed.
We'll know naught of this item till its<cf>curse is undone.
'Tis cursed... Might someone aid us in<cf>dispelling it?
Best we brought that to one well-versed in<cf>the removal of curses.
'Tis open. We can pass through here.
Shall we head this way?
Rrgh, 'tis too dark...
'Tis the blackest dark I've ever known.
Tread carefully. Mark each step well.
This place is sure death without a lantern.
We've need of a light afore we go anywhere.
Have we sufficient stores of oil?
Better we walked, not ran.
Keep the lantern dry!
We know not what's inside...best be<cf>prepared for anything.
Be cautious when opening chests, ser.
Be wary! There are beasts that dwell<cf>within such chests.
Asking after Salvation are you? You'll be one of Mason's friends, no doubt.
All too eager, that one. He's been questioning everyone with ears to listen.
If it's Mason you're after, he spends his days in the slums, last I saw.
If you want to know aught about Salvation, like as not he has your answer.
You have chosen peace? ...Then peace shall you know.
Leave now, and you will never again come to see this place.
Run!
Hail, traveler! Come for the capital with pockets lined with gold, are you? ...No?
Aye, well, you're not alone in that, friend. The dragon's coming has put a pinch on all our purses.
Say, have you chanced upon the falls near the encampment? There's a cave secreted behind.
Full of old ruins, too. I walked in a few paces once, curious to see how far it went.
My nerve left me past that, though it grieves me to imagine all the treasure I missed...
If you've the mettle and the interest, pray, go now while there's treasure left to be had.
Perhaps you'll come back to share your findings in recompense for the tip, eh? ...No?

This way! Hurry!
Run, master! Quickly!
We must away!
We cannot face it here!
We need an open area!
This is no place to fight -- just run!
Hurry, master! That way!
'Tis ample space to fight! Attack!
This place will serve!
We can fight it freely here!
Tis finally time to fight back!
Take shelter from the flames!
We're safe from the dragon's fire here.
Fire -- get behind the rubble!
Use the rubble as a shield till the<cf>flames pass!
It flies!
'Tis aloft!?
It flees!?
Where is it going...?
Give chase! We must finish it!
Come on -- we must defeat it!
We've no choice but to follow...
After it! We finish this here!
Dragon!
The wyrm...here!?
Th-the bridge!
The bridge looks unstable...
Oh no... It's going to--
Ah!
We must cross, afore it falls!
The bridge crumbles!
Hurry! The bridge is collapsing!
Make haste!
We cannot turn back! Onward, hurry!
It attacks from the skies...
Here, Arisen! Quickly!
Come! Hurry!
This place is safe, for now!
This is firm ground, master. Quickly!
We make for the final tower!
We'd be mad to fight the dragon here!
Let's make for that tower!
Onward, Arisen! Quickly!
We cannot stop now!
There -- there we could face the<cf>dragon!
Let's fight the wyrm at that tower!
That tower -- let's make our stand<cf>there!
Does it mean to stay there?
'Tis a vexing place to have the wyrm<cf>roost...
Seems the dragon means to finish us<cf>there...
This fight is mine! You hurry onward!
I'll hold its attention! Go on, Arisen!
I'll buy you time, get out of here!
I shall join you!
Here I come!
Hold, Arisen! I am coming!
Not again!
This part falls as well?
'Tis crumbling! Hurry!
The bridge is falling! Come on!
We must hurry!
Quickly! This way!
Here, master! Hurry!
Faster, Arisen! The bridge won't hold!
There's a ballista, master!
We should use the ballista!
Returning fire!
I can reach it--!
I'll bring you down...
'Tis within my range!
We can make our stand here!
We'll strike at it from the tower ahead!
Return fire with that ballista!
The dragon!
A clan of dragons!
Look, there! The dragon!
The Ur-Dragon!
Look -- the Ur-Dragon!
I'll send you aloft!<cf>Grab hold and attack!
Here, Master! Grab hold and attack!
Strike the moment it breathes fire!
I'll strike its mouth as it<cf>unleashes fire!
Take aim for its mouth as it<cf>breathes fire!
Its breath discharged! 'Tis our chance!
We dispelled its fire! Now, attack!
Quickly! The heart is unprotected!
'Tis spent, and open to attack!
'Tis exhausted! Strike at its heart!
I'll rend its heart with this blow!
Now, Master! Aim for its heart!
The heart, Arisen! Attack the heart!
I'll be its meal! You attack!
I gladly give this body for the Arisen!
Nraaaagh! N-now, Master! Attack!
I doubt fire would do much...
Magick is our best means<cf>of fighting the wyrm!
We must get at its heart!
Nary an ash would remain<cf>after that breath...
The wyrm's voice holds us in thrall!
If we could spark its breath to<cf>explode early...
The wyrm is spent! Attack!
It counters our magick!
Join me -- strike its heart!
Its wings may be vulnerable as well!
'Tis aloft! Brace for a dive!
It's alighted on the tower!
How do we fight such a thing?
Its scales are hard as steel!
Seems the heart alone is vulnerable.
Have we even hurt the beast?
Ngh! Its voice rings in my head...
Watch! It readies flame in its maw!
The wyrm's body is gone black!
There must be some way to create an<cf>opening!
We cannot reach it from the ground!
Combat it with holy light!
Attack the head to create an opening!
Its bones are immune to attacks!
There! Its heart lies exposed!
The dragon's flesh is wrought from<cf>the hearts of Arisen.
The names of all who've slain the wyrm<cf>are here immortalized in stone.
Th-that dragon...!
The dragon exists by devouring the<cf>hearts of Arisen.
Those pawns' minds are warped...
Our master has routed the dragon!
Our master has felled the terrible<cf>wyrm!
Ice serves against the wyrm!
Strike at its heart!
Aim for the head as it readies its<cf>breath!
Its breath burns all in its path!
'Tis folly to attack it head-on!
The dragon's heart resonates with<cf>the Arisen.
Magick ill serves against that dragon.
Strike at it with steel!
Quickly! We must dispel the curse!
Stay clear of its breath!<cf>You'll be frozen!
If we could but stop its fire breath...
The wyrm counters our magick!
A voice calls out in my mind...
I feel magick nearby.<cf>Extremely powerful.
We must gird ourselves against<cf>its magick!
Lightning is no use against it!
The wings, Master!<cf>Strike it from the sky!
We'll get nowhere while it's aloft!
Its breath can shock as sure as<cf>lightning!
Scale its back, then strike!
Now! Let's pull it down!
We'll not get at its heart, save<cf>from its back!
'Tis grounded, Master! Now, attack!
A voice...from above?
We need some means of fighting it<cf>aloft!
How do we fight such a thing?
Attack when it reels!
'Tis useless to strike at its bones!
A sinister aura waits ahead...
'Tis not a foe we can stand against!
Are they...pawns? Something is amiss...
Do we flee!? We cannot win like this!
Our blows scarce earn a flinch!
Old tales speak of the wyrm baring<cf>its heart at the Arisen's touch.
Do you recall some way to expose<cf>the wyrm's heart, Master?
The dragon!? Why... How!?
Our magick is near useless...
Curative magick!? That's trouble.
How do we get at its heart...?
C-cold! ...Is that ice!?
Strike its forelegs! Bring it down!
Its wingbeats alone are overpowering!
Such magick...!
It wields magick of the highest<cf>order!
M-my body...
Strike where the beast glows!
Blows to darkened areas are useless!
Black flame!?
Its heart! It must be here!
Aye, it felt that!
How many Arisen have become a<cf>meal for this beast...?
'Tis near fully fleshed... I fear<cf>this will be a battle most fierce...
The beast... It seems half rotted away...
Drake!
A clan of drakes!
There, Master! Drakes!
A drake! There!
Wyrm!
A clan of wyrms!
There, Master! Wyrms!
A wyrm -- there!
Wyvern!
A clan of wyverns!
There, Master! Wyverns!
A wyvern comes!
'Tis aggressive.
It's taken our bait.
Strike, while it's busy with me!
Buy me time enough to cast!
I'll strike its horn!
The horn is destroyed!
There! The heart lies exposed!
Wise, this one...
High-order magick brings swift<cf>retribution from this beast.
It shows no sign of taking flight.
It aims to hobble us! We cannot win<cf>in such a condition!
There, in the sky... A dragon?
Do not let it throw you from the<cf>sky!
It descends! Now, attack!
The walking corpse of a wyrm...?!
That dragon's near rotted through!
Cursed dragon!
There, a cursed dragon!
A clan of cursed dragons!
'Tis like the crystal in its breast<cf>animates it!
It seems holy light holds little effect!
Strike at its breast!
There! The point of light upon its chest!
Stay clear of its putrefying breath!
Its breath curses perishables to rot!
'Tis more impulse than reason. It attacks<cf>without thinking!
Augh, that stench! It assaults the senses!
I shall draw the dragon's ire! Strike the<cf>mage!
The dragon stands again!
The beast has begun casting spells!
'Tis different than it was a moment ago!
The necromancer has possessed it!
Ngh!
Grh!
Gyaaa...
Hngh!
Hrngh!
How fare you?
Beg pardon, ser.
Agreed.
Mmm...
I thank you.
This... This is more than I deserve.
Mm? It's a strange traveler comes to a place like this.
You'll find naught here but danger. If you're wise, you'll quit this place directly.
Arisen, you say?
We've had no word from Gran Soren.
Arisen or no, I cannot allow you within the hold.
It is custom to aid the Arisen in their travels, but I fear there's naught I can offer you.
Without His Grace's word, I cannot allow you within the hold.
Hail, Arisen. Are you here at the duke's behest?
The wall's withstood all manner of beast, but it seemed a silk curtain before the dragon.
Perhaps it is vainglory for man to stand against the wyrm.
The dragon...slain!?
Then fly to Gran Soren and bring word to the duke. Make haste, ser!
What meaning can there be now in standing watch over this pile of stones?
This... This is more than I deserve.
Rifts allow you to search for and hire<cf>pawns that meet your particular needs.
Speak with a pawn to enlist him or her<cf>as a party member.
The main pawn you created can travel<cf>to other worlds online to assist other<cf>players in their travels.
These adventures can result in new<cf>knowledge, items, and equipment they<cf>bring back when they return.
Your main pawn will earn rift crystals<cf>while online in other worlds. Encourage<cf>other players to enlist your minion!
A Ferrystone will spirit you back to Gran<cf>Soren in an instant, no matter where you<cf>are located.
It is by far the fastest and safest method<cf>of travel, but each stone disappears after<cf>a single use.
You can equip yourself with a primary and<cf>a secondary weapon.
Primary weapons such as swords and daggers<cf>are combat essentials. Secondary weapons<cf>like bows and shields offer support.
In addition to weapons and armor, you can<cf>also equip accoutrements with certain special<cf>abilities to give you an edge in battle.
Only one piece of jewelry and a single<cf>cloak can be equipped as accoutrements<cf>at any one time.
A heavy load will cause your Stamina to<cf>deplete more quickly. Sell or discard<cf>any and all items you no longer need.
Your lantern consumes oil. If it dims,<cf>use a Flask of Oil to refill it.
Some items can be combined with others to<cf>produce surprising results. Experiment and<cf>see what you come up with. 
Place waypoint markers on your map to<cf>keep track of your progress.
If you've forgotten where you are in the story,<cf>select "Chronicle" from the Pause Menu to<cf>review a history of your journey thus far.
Select "Options" from the Pause Menu to<cf>customize your mini-map and status display.
The higher the fall, the more damage you<cf>will suffer.
Note that you move somewhat slower while<cf>your weapon is drawn.
Exhausting all Stamina will make you unable<cf>to act for a time. Take care to conserve<cf>energy!
You can attack while clinging to foes.
Petrifaction cannot be cured by normal<cf>magick, and is fatal if left untreated.
Use Secret Softener or the like to<cf>cure any petrified allies.
Your rank within a vocation rises as you<cf>defeat foes and complete quests. At higher<cf>ranks, a broader variety of skills are available.
Defeating foes and completing quests earns<cf>you more discipline, boosting your prowess<cf>in a vocation.
Pawns will collect and use items of their<cf>own volition.
You cannot carry or purchase items that<cf>would cause you to exceed your maximum<cf>encumbrance.
Press <TUTO><SIZE 25><ICON TOUCH></SIZE> while climbing down a ladder<cf>to descend quickly. 
If a pawn remains unconscious for too long,<cf>they will be forfeit.
Your support pawn has become forfeit, and<cf>returned to the realm whence they came.
Your main pawn has become forfeit,<cf>disappearing and returning to the rift.
You cannot join covenants with other pawns<cf>while your main pawn is forfeit.
Touch any riftstone to return your lost<cf>main pawn to your side.
If a support pawn is forfeit, any items<cf>they were carrying are sent to item storage.
You can send off departing pawns with a<cf>single item as a gift for their creator.
You can pass items to and from your pawns<cf>on the sub menu.
The Elysion spoke of you... Said the Arisen ran counter to the tides. A heretic, he said.
But I... I see you a reasonable sort. The sort like to hear reason...aye?
Come, ser. What's to be gained from bloodying your hands?
There's naught can stay the dragon's fire. What say we await perdition together?
There's many a pleasure to indulge in ere salvation comes. I'll gladly furnish the coin!
Pray, spare me, Arisen, that I may live to see the flame. You'll be well rewarded!
Don't be a fool, ser. Surely my gold is worth more to you than my head?
Nnh?
Where... What manner of place is this? Why am I here?
Wh-what's...happened to me?
Stay back! S-stay... Aaaaugh!
'Tis locked. You haven't the key to fit it...
'Tis caught on something. Perhaps it could open from the far side.
'Tis barred shut. Might be able to break the bolt.
'Tis shut tight.
'Tis no use at this hour. You'll have to come again later.
Best stop for now.
Seems they're closed.
Someone was here...
Lost them...
Gone...
Perhaps you've upset them.
There's naught to do here.
Best you moved on.
Not here...
The door is closed.
Shows no sign of opening.
There's aught there...
You don't see anything.
That smell...
Someone's near...
What's this...?
Fine view from here.
There's aught written here...
Must be a way to find something...
Smells delicious.
Perfect spot to place something.
You can almost reach...
There appears to be aught ahead.
That fall could kill.
'Tis dangerous to touch.
A strong blow might break it.
Perhaps if you came by night.
Perhaps if you came by day.
Perhaps if you came at dawn.
Perhaps if you came at dusk.
There's aught buried here...
You see no way up.
'Tis slick, this spot.
No use pressing any further.
No need to double back further.
No time for that now.
You cannot carry any more.
There may yet be aught lying about.
Seems there's naught you can take on at present.<cf>Best to try again later.
Perhaps with a bit of help...
Best you kept your weapon sheathed.
Is someone here...?
'Tis a place for tall folk.
'Tis a place for small folk.
Had you a woman in your band...
Had you a man in your band...
Had you a strong companion...
Had you a swift companion...
Had you a magick user...
Had you an apt climber...
Had you a skilled jumper...
This weapon will not help you.
That armor won't protect you.
You're ill equipped for this.
Seems it can't be used now.
You'll get no further use from it.
'Tis useless, now.
Hmm, not with your current equipment...
Not with your current party...
You hear aught from further in.
Enemies... They're close.
Best you got some rest.
You can carry no more!
You're too exhausted!
"Danger! Keep Out!"
"No Trespassing"
A sign.
Had you an Empty Flask, you might fill it here.
You'll get no further without a lantern.
'Tis dangerous to fumble about in the dark. Best find a light.
Best not just leave them.
If aught were left here, it would rot.
Best take care you don't get lost.
Best check the map.
You're due for a rest.
This place is dangerous by night.
This place is dangerous by day.
Breathtaking...
You'll get no further!
Seems you'll need to come back.
Nothing left here.
It looks fit to crumble.
Seems it could be moved...
It will not budge.
It will not open.
Seems you need a key.
Seems you need a Pickaxe here.
You yet lack the experience.
You yet lack the skill.
Not with your current vocation...
You'll not pass through this gate.
You've no time!
Seems you were too late.
You may make it, yet.
You're doing well for time.
Seems you've come at the wrong time.
There may be another path.
'Tis a powerful weapon... Too bad it doesn't work.

'Twas shock enough to hear Salvation had a hand in the northern revolt...
'Tis a painful thing to hear it was Lord Julien what lead them, though.
It's been a promise of old that the neighboring lands should band together in times of danger...
But I suppose such times are as given to politics and intrigue as any other.
The uprising at the stronghold was Salvation's handiwork. Villains all, those zealots...
'Tis a painful thing to hear it was Lord Julien what lead them, though.
I'd always heard him told a good and noble knight. I suppose the greatest of men is still human.
He'll be rotting in a cell below the castle now. 'Tis a terrible waste...
Oof.
Uaugh...
Eaaagh...
Hah.
Yaah!
Well, I trust?
Fare well.
Mm, aye.
No, no.
Thank you!
Oh, that's lovely! Thank you!
Well met, ser!
<BABA>What will it be today, mm?
<PL>
<PAWN 0>
Never mind
Go on, indulge a whim! What's the harm?
You just choose and leave the rest to me.
Made your decision, then?
Oh, lovely.
Fine choice, Arisen.
If you lack the coin, I can't help you.
Mm, that's charming!
A fine result, if you'll permit me saying.
Most striking mane in Gran Soren, that.
Done!
My thanks for your patience.
Come again soon!
Welcome. The Arisen, is it? I've heard talk on the winds.
Devyn, if it please you. I was a doctor afore taking up a barber's shears.
With the dragon come, I'd like do better business playing sawbones again... Ah, well.
Talk is, you're fast rising within the duke's court.
You'll be needing a courtly appearance then, eh? What say we start with that hair?
You'd be wise to mind your appearance, Arisen.
'Twas a wise fellow said the mien makes the man.
They say 'tis a fool judges a book by its cover, but the cover's part of the book, same as the pages, aye?
All eyes are on you, Arisen. Why not give them aught to look at?
You're serious at heart. So perhaps you might allow a little whimsy into your manner?
Aye, times are dark, but this drudgery's worse than any dragon.
We can't change fate, but we can change our hair, aye? Let's live while we're alive!
So? Fancy my shop, Arisen?
Maker only knows what's to become of this city...
Perhaps it's time to think of moving on, though I'm loath to leave the shop...
No man can say what tomorrow holds. Best enjoy today, then, aye?
I may not look it, but I've the nerve of a boar and a head twice as hard.
Let the dragon come. I'll invite him in and do his hair.
Here for a cut? Aye, we're still open. ...We're a queer pair, aren't we, you and I?
The old routines are all that keep me sane amid all this madness.
A change of color can change a person's whole outlook. What do you say?
Basic Styling
Standard Makeover
Full Course Facial
Royal Treatment

'Twill be slow going, just us two.
We've need of numbers. Let's ask the<cf>other pawns' help.
This oughtn't take long.
This seems a task for raw muscle.
A Fighter would make short work of<cf>them.
These scarecrows demand more than<cf>brute force.
'Tis a task fit for a Mage.
Knowing when to employ muscle and<cf>when magick is key...
You'd do well to slay the lot of them<cf>at once.
Arrows and spells can reach distant<cf>targets.
Anything you've overlooked, Master?
Keep the order of your targets well<cf>in mind.
Calm consideration ever wins the day,<cf>Master.
You'll no doubt have cause to call my<cf>kind through the rift in times future.
Note each pawn's traits and strengths,<cf>and tailor your party accordingly.
You can exchange pawns anywhere you<cf>find one of these "rifts".
Let us return to the encampment.
It's meaningless... The lot of it is mad.
Leave me--pray, haunt me no more! I can go no further...
You! You met with the dragon!
And don't think for a minute<cf>I don't know what you did then.
I... I of all men!
No human hands could fell that beast. No...
You took the dragon's bargain!
You conspired with it to wither me<cf>and usurp my seat as duke!
But you'll not be quit of me so easily!

State your business!
Who goes there!?
Where d'you think you're going?
Halt!
You'll go no farther!
M-my deepest apologies...
What brings you here, ser?
I cannot allow even the Arisen to pass unbidden.
I would thank you to refrain from such actions in the future, ser...
I'm one grand bruise... 'Tis a wonder I'm alive.
My thanks for your aid, cousin. I'm hale and hearty for your efforts.
In truth, to move about freely 'tis a blessing too oft forgot.
I feel well better than I did, though my back ails me still...
Found you!
Over there!
Let none escape!
Kill the lot of them if you must!

Hold, minnow. I'd have your ear a moment.
It's been a full sun since last I saw Quina.
She spoke o' the Witchwood to find a cure for your wound. If she's gone there for true...
I beg of you: Find Quina and see her back safely, ere some ill befalls her.
Quina feels for you, she does. Your wound is oft on her mind.
I thought her holed up in her room, poring over one tome or another, but at last look I found her gone.
She mostlike stumbled on some remedy for your condition and set out in search o' it.
The lass never was one to sit idle. I only pray danger passes her by.
Quina is safe? Thank the Maker!
Pray, forgive her. If she acts the fool, 'tis only 'cause concern o'erwhelms her sense.
She's like you in that. Always setting off without so much as a thought...
Mostlike the fault of ill parenting...which makes the blame mine then, eh!?
Quina is yet missing from the village.
To think she dared the Witchwood... That forest turns the stoutest man craven!
I imagine her in pursuit of some aid for your wound.
Pray, forgive her foolishness. It's only worry for you that leads her so.
Been by the encampment yet, minnow?
If you've business left undone there, best pay a visit.
Come to think of it, I wonder how the Enlistment Corps fares.
They'll not linger at that camp long. If you've reason to see them, best act soon, mm?
Quina will keep, child. Don't worry yourself over her.
Pray, might I beg a favor, Arisen?
Your help would be most welcome in this matter.
Hear him out
Not now
Excellent. Allow me to explain:
A client has asked of us to locate certain raw materials from across the realm.
Such is well and good, but some regions hold more peril than others, the Everfall above all others...
If you might aid us, the first item we require is posted on yon board.
Many thanks, Arisen. I pray no evil befalls you on your journey.
I'll not question your judgment, Arisen. Perhaps some other time.
Aye, that's it for true. Thank you.
The next item we require is on the board.
You yet lack the requested material, Arisen. Pray find it quickly.
Another item we require is on the board.
Ngh.
Nragh!
Nraaaugh...
Ho!
Hyaah!
Doing well, are you?
Right, then.
Mm.
No, no.
How nice.
Oh, this is delightful!
That's the one, is it?
Ahh, a fine selection!
I'll not be mocked, ser.
Hmm, what say you to this?
Aye, I'll take it.
There, have it.
All right, very well!
You must know that's not possible.
The dragon? Yes, of course I've heard the news.
But what good is it to fret over a fate that may or may not come?
I built my fortune from nothing, in a single generation.
I'm well familiar with risk. I won't be told what to fear.
There's good sense in serving as the Arisen's patron.
All I invest now will come back to me tenfold should you manage to slay the wyrm.
Buy low, sell high.
That's the first lesson of business, friend.
Augh, enough! You've wasted enough of my time!
Augh, I scraped past by the skin of my teeth there... That, and a good bit of help from you.
I'm not a fool, ser. I'll not play at perfect innocence.
What successful man ever has? The Maker gave us shade that we might get a damned thing done.
Still, there's plenty to stoke the people's ill will these days.
We've not managed a thing to stay the dragon from... Ah, forgive me. I do not mean to blame you, friend.
All men die when their time is come. I say why not live well in the meantime?
Met with His Grace, have you? You're a lucky one, you are.
Gran Soren has seen its share of Arisen, most of them coarse as a common thief.
It's a rare thing to find one whose feats earn the Duke's good graces.
Now all that remains is for you to slay the dragon.
Do that, and you may be Duke yourself afore long.
Hmm, yes, in fact...
I've half a mind to introduce you to my daughter.
A merchant's only as good as his eyes, friend.
And my eyes say the capital stands even odds of being claimed by the dragon.
When I look at you, though...
I get to feeling the scales tip in favor of us driving back the beast.
Seems I had the right of it where the dragon's concerned.
Shame it feels a bit early to celebrate just yet... What a world...
Oh, this is delightful!
<SHOP>Any rarities to sell? I'll pay you handsomely!

Never mind
Right, then.
How nice.

What is that...?<cf>'Tis a haunting sound...
What... what is that sound!?
Do you hear that?<cf>What a sinister noise...
It seems the noise is that monster's<cf>doing.
That sound...<cf>It seems to come from the mist itself.
This mist moves queerly...
A most unwelcome mist...
That queer sound...<cf>There's a phantom near!
'Tis the baleful sound of a phantom!
Stay wary! I hear a phantom about!
A phantom draws near...
'Tis the cry of a phantom...<cf>Shall we go?
A phantom, Arisen...<cf>Let's put the creature to rest!
'Tis only a phantom's cry.<cf>We needn't fear.
That sound... 'Tis no concern<cf>of ours. Best we press on.
I hear a phantom...<cf>Let's slay it and hurry on.
A phantom's cry...<cf>We needn't waste our time.
Be ready... It comes!
We've naught to fear from its ilk.
Phantoms fall quickly before holy<cf>attacks.
Holy magick is the bane of phantoms.
Holy magick is far more effective<cf>than common attacks.
Evil beings are quickly routed with<cf>holy magick!
If it possesses you, come into the<cf>path of an ally's attack.
Come into one of our attacks, master!
A blow from one of us will free you<cf>from its control!
I'll lay the phantom to rest!
Let's strike it down!
'Twas less effective than I'd hoped...
Seems we'll need more than<cf>common attacks...
We'll need magick to defeat it.
I'll see how it takes to magick!
Finish it with magick!
Magick will avail where muscle<cf>will not!
We need magick to fell this beast!
Banish the spirit with holy magick!
I'll strike it with holy light!
'Tis weak to holy magick!
Your weakness is known, fiend!<cf>Come, holy light!
Holy magick strikes at its very core!
Let us watch and wait...
'Tis a fool rushes in against an<cf>unknown foe.
I shall watch the spirit's actions.
Patience, and vigilance, Arisen.
'Tis a job for holy magick!
We cannot let it wail!<cf>I'll respond with magickal light!
Attacking it may help!
I'll pry it loose with an attack!
It's relinquished its hold.
Thank goodness...
I'm relieved you're safe.
We must take more care in the future.
Run into my spell, master!
I'll cast a spell! Step into the blast!
I'll call forth holy light!
I'll tear it loose with sacred light!
I'll have it off with a holy spell!
Begone, be purged by the light!
Phantom!
A plague of phantoms!
There, Master! Phantoms!
A phantom comes!
Specter!
A plague of specters!
There, Master! Specters!
A specter, Master! There!
Phantasm!
A plague of phantasms!
There, Master! Phantasms!
A phantasm comes!
Phantom, Arisen! Stay ready!
A forsaken soul floats in the air!
A ghost hovers ahead!
Above us! A phantom!
Don't allow it to possess you!
I cannot ken what it will do!
It draws the life from its host!
It grows with the life it steals!
We must end this, quickly!
Avoid a protracted battle!
Do not let them close!
Seems it ill likes magick!
Perhaps magick will serve!
Now, while it inhabits a host!
Strike while it holds a host!
'Tis not too late! I'll have it off!
Ngh... The pain!
Be gone, pest!
Help me! Hurry!
Th-the darkness comes...
I am possessed! Help me!
Augh! Let...go!
'Tis worse than a phantom!
A phantasm, Arisen!
A wicked spirit lingers there!
A vile ghost, above us!
It drains life with a fearsome hunger!
It drinks life faster than a phantom!
Its host's life is drained in an instant!
Tis an apparition worse<cf>than a phantom!
A specter, Arisen. Stay ready.
'Tis a soul most evil floats there.
'Tis nemesis to all pawns!
If it takes hold of a pawn, 'tis death!
All consciousness ends once it<cf>takes hold.
Specters must be dealt with first!
Swords are useless!
Steel works once it's taken a host!
It grows by stealing the life of others!
The large ones steal life in an instant!
It only took an instant...
An ally's blow will dislodge the ghost!
Allow an ally to strike you! Quickly!
Someone, hurry! Attack!
Attack to free our ally from its thrall!
An enchanted blade finds purchase.
The possessed cannot free<cf>themselves! Stay close!
The air is heavy with a phantom's<cf>stench...
The hairs on my neck stand on end...
Lightning courses through them!
A simple touch can shock you!
'Tis dangerous to fight by the water!
I feel pins and needles...<cf>Phantasms, Master.
The air grows tense...
Captured pawns lose themselves!
A pawn's been enslaved!
I feel ill... Specters. They're close.
'Tis difficult to breathe...
My weapon passes through it!
Seems magick finds them well enough!
Swords serve only while they<cf>inhabit a host!
It grew!?
'Tis larger than most!
What!? ...I cannot get loose!
'Tis no common phantom!
This phantom is charged with<cf>lightning!
I feel a wicked power at work...
What is--? Ghkk... No!
It shows itself as it possesses<cf>a host!
Call for help if a phantom takes<cf>hold.
Phantoms release their hosts when<cf>attacked!
Give a call if you're possessed!
'Tis dangerous to fight while doused!
A crimson mist...? Quite strange.
This mist is an ill omen...
Wraith!
Wraiths! Stand ready!
A plague of wraiths!
Steel finds no purchase against wraiths!
Holy light is what we need!
Magicks other than light have little effect!
Free the possessed immediately!
I feel suddenly chill...
I believed myself the one to end the great cycle. To free the world... Yet here I reach my meager end, lost in quiet oblivion.
Where might we find Salomet's grimoire?
Which group of bandits has taken the<cf>book? If only we knew...
We know where the grimoire's gone.<cf>'Tis a start.
Seems Maul holds our grimoire.
Best prepare to cut down a few thieves.
We're lucky 'tis Maul took it.
We may learn aught from Camilla,<cf>the sundries vendor in Gran Soren.
Let's return to Steffen.
Why the forgery, Arisen?
Will you give Steffen the fake?
We walk in bandit lands. Best we gave<cf>them a wide berth, Arisen.
We walk in bandit lands. They suffer only<cf>allies to pass unchallenged.
There... That fellow's under attack.
That traveler! We must help him!
That narrows our search. Let's make for the<cf>south.
Were we right to do as we did, Arisen? He<cf>seemed pleased, but I cannot shake this guilt.
If I recall, there's a treasure<cf>chest atop this fort's tower.
These are bandits, Master. No doubt<cf>they've hidden the tome carefully.
Perhaps it's time we began our search<cf>for this magick book, Master?
It seems we've completed our task, at the very least.
Don't be careless.
Take care you don't fall, Master.
Should be around here.
I see it! Over there!
Upward, Master.
There's a way up here.
Not that way.
Our task is done.<cf>Let us report our progress.
Down below, Arisen.
Ah, it's you, goodfisher. I fear my spirits are damp as the morning sands.
I suppose I ought be thankful just to be alive, but...still...
I've regained my stride, I have. The body's finally given to listening to me again.
'Tis thanks to you, goodfisher.
Still, I'll not be straying far, long as the roads are crawling with beasts of all sort.
Maker be good, you're all right!
I'd a mind to stand against the dragon, too. In truth, I did...
But what can a man do against such a thing?
You stood your ground just the same. You're a brave one...or plain mad.
When I heard you were abed with injury, I feared the worst.
But from the look of you, you'll mend just fine. Sturdy as a galley mast, you are.
When I heard you were abed with injury, I feared the worst.
But from the look of you, you'll mend just fine. Sturdy as a galley mast, you are.
It is time to decide.
Will you claim your right as Arisen?
Or shrug the burden and seek peace in oblivion?
Just so.
One foot after the next, come what may.
That is what it means to live.
Turn back now and I will grant you a merciful death.
The choice is yours, Arisen.
Yours alone.
Hold! None may enter the castle without permission.
Pardons, ser, but I've no time for chatter -- there's my duty to attend. Fare well. 
Be you the Arisen? For true?
And yet, it seems you lack a license...
My apologies...Arisen.
Rule of the Guard forbids me from speaking with any who lack a Wyrm Hunt license.
Ah, Arisen. My men have told me much of you. I have expected your visit.
I am Ser Maximilian Eizenstern, Captain of the Hunt, so named by His Grace Duke Edmun Dragonsbane.
I beg your forbearance whilst I detail what is expected of you in the Hunt.
The Wyrm Hunt license you carry permits the bearer to undertake the most vital of tasks:
Those missions given by Duke Edmun himself.
Of late, all our will is focused on the learning of, and defending against, the wicked dragon.
A weighty task, to be sure, but one which the fate of the realm and its people rests upon.
I am under orders to lend Arisen all reasonable aid as they might require.
I would pray you return this assistance in kind. Many hopes are pinned upon you, ser.
It would be my honor to show you the ready charges for the Wyrm Hunt.
The choice is yours...
Decipher a text
Rout a monster infestation
Investigate a cult
Aid a research team
Hear the duke's directive
Nothing for now
Of course... Mostlike you have preparations to make ere you take up your duty.
Give the word when you are ready.
Certainly. Then here are the details...
This is a high honor, Arisen. See you do not take it lightly. Here are the details...
I've word that His Grace has seen fit to grant you a special audience, no doubt due to your heroic efforts. I trust you will receive the honor.
A sorcerer, eh? Can't say as I've heard tell of...
No, wait. There is rumor going around of a queerly dressed man skulking about the quarry.
More than his dress is odd if he's hanging around that place with no reason.
The beast must die.
'Tis close... I can feel it.
We have it outmanned.
There... No, this way.
Where are you...
We must get closer.
You cannot win, beast.
Stubborn creature...
Hngh!
Above? ...Or below?
It will take better than that!
No!
Honorless vulture!
Gah!
Pride...blinded me...
Graaaugh!
Nrrraaaaaagh!
I'll kill you! I'll tear the wings from your frame!
Heed this, beast! You end here and now!
Why? Why!?
Th-thank you, Arisen...
The griffin was strong...
Will the dragon be stronger still?
...Then it will be a hunt to remember.
There's been a shipment of goods. The road is closed till it's been sorted.
Have patience. It won't be long.
State your business. ...The Pawn Guild, is it?
All right. Through here and to the left. Just don't make a nuisance of yourself, aye?
Pawn Guild? It's past here and to the left.
The road has opened. You're free to pass, but I'll thank you not to make trouble with that lot.
'Tis an unexpected sight.
Seems they're all abandoned.
'Tis a city...of sorts.
Stripped of its people, this place feels...<cf>cold, somehow.
Such a grand door gives one pause.
I feel naught but murderous intent<cf>beyond...
A traveler, eh? An uncommon sight in these times.
You seem to ken which end of the sword goes into the monster. Perhaps you'd like to join the guard?
One doesn't join the guard for the pay. Or the glory. Or the camaraderie...
Hold on, then... Where did I mean to go with that...
Must be nice, being Arisen and all. I wager you earn enough coin for some finer weapons, for one.
Meanwhile it's a fortunate guard whose blade can hold an edge at all.
And armor? Pah! They truly believe we can stand up to a dragon with equipment the likes of this?
Name me craven if you like, but first sign of that dragon and I'll shed my armor and be off like the wind.
His Grace once bested the dragon, you know?
But time and prosperity have made him soft, and his esteem among the guard falls with each passing day.
I'm not the only guardsman who harbors thoughts of desertion. We're all of us just biding our days...
We were fools to believe we were ever really safe here...
The duke is late with our coin. I've still not been paid...
And now, with that business at the Greatwall? Aye, I'll not be here much longer.
Us in the guard wish you the best against the dragon.
But uh... Well, don't take it as an offense, but we're not exactly counting on it, like.  
Do not allow it flight!
Strike, afore it flies higher!
Take aim at its wings!
Quick! While it's enraged! 
Now! Strip its wings with fire!
I'll hold it down!
Burnt wings cannot fly!
Its head is in reach!
Strike, afore it flies higher!
I shall ground it!
Bring it down-- aim for the wings!
I'll send you skyward!<cf>Strike its head!
I'll send you skyward! Grab hold!
I'll send you skyward!<cf>Let it taste your steel!
Look out, it's diving!
We must bring it to ground.
Its wings are ablaze!<cf>That should ground it!
Tis massive... We are lucky to find<cf>it sleeping.
There, in the sky... A monster?
Look to the sky! A giant beast!
It seems willing to let us pass...
We'd best leave it be.
We can but wait for the beast to<cf>descend.
So long as it flies above,<cf>'tis little we can do against it.
Griffin!
The griffin flies near!
Look up -- griffin!
Ready yourself! 'Tis a powerful<cf>foe!
We're no match for its strength.<cf>We must outsmart it!
We must lure the beast to earth!
If you grab it, it will not fly!
Mount it ere it takes to the sky!
It ill liked that! Aim for its head!
Those wings burn easily.
Fire, Arisen! Set its wings ablaze!
In this state, it will mount no defense!
I'll lure it down!
Now! Strike the wings!
Now, while it's down!
I'll send you to the griffin!
Focus on the head...<cf>even a griffin must fall!
I'll strike its head while it<cf>reels!
I'll aim for its wings!
Its head is poorly protected.
Let's drag it to the ground!
While it reels! Knock it from the sky!
Griffin!
A griffin colony!
There, Master! Griffins!
There, Master -- a griffin!
Cockatrice!
A brood of cockatrices!
There, Master! Cockatrices!
Look there, a cockatrice!
A... A cockatrice!
'Tis some monstrous chicken!
What monstrosity is this!?
'Tis a great winged beast!
It bears the head of a cock!
It must have some weakness...
Seek out its weakness!
Lightning serves well! Rain it down!
It thrashes about! I'll cast lightning!
A bolt of lightning will have it down!
Blind the beast and it will panic!
It readies its breath! Strike its throat!
Petrifying breath! I'll strike its throat!
Seems its talons bear poison.
Petrifying breath! Stand well clear!
Beware its roar!
Draw it away from the tribute!<cf>Use lightning!
Birds cannot fly by night for<cf>the darkness.
Aim for the bulge in its throat!
Watch carefully. Anticipate its actions!
Mm? 'Twas a strange sound just now...
Something massive awaits below...
Do not harm the tribute!
'Tis storing its power!?
A griffin... No! 'Tis...hideous!
It thrashes in its blindness!
Now! Cut away its legs!

Come, Arisen...
Forge in my fire the next link in the endless chain...
Now, choose. Flee, or step forth...

Ngh.
Gragh...
Waaaugh...
Hah.
Haah!
Hey, cos!
Till next time.
Oh, yes.
Mmmm...
My thanks.
You've made me a happy man!
Hm? What is it?
Another time, cos.
Take a look, cos?
See aught you like?
Ah, a fine choice.
Right, then!
Come by any time.
Always quick with a jape, you.
Hmm, this sound about fair?
All right, then.
Here you are.
Deal.
Not even for you, cos.
Ah, what's to become of us next, I wonder...
Times like these, you really appreciate peace.
I hope all this bloodshed will soon end.
How long until all this calms down, d'you suppose?
You would never catch me fighting any monster.
What's a man to do in such times?
Take a look, cos?
You've made me a happy man!
That was far too close for my liking...
Here, take this. Let it be of use to you, ser.
What do you think you're doing here?
Be off with you!
You great ass, away with you!
Are you brave? Or just mule-headed?
This is no place for the likes of you.
If you wish to travel with the Reaper, I'll gladly pay your toll.
I'm not of a mind to suffer fools... I am of a mind to make fools suffer.
Your brain must be dryer than a granny's...hmph.
Can't you bother someone else?
Stubborn as an ass, you are...
I trust you are well?
Hoy!
Bloodsuckers!
They've really done it now.
It beggars belief...
This insult cannot be allowed to stand.
Now: the perfect revenge...
Aye, that is so...
What?
I see...
And what then?
Stubborn child...
Whate'er meaning life holds...
It makes men deaf to all reason...
Heed me well, Arisen.
In my death, you've won a future for this world...
But what that future spells for you...<cf>For all men...
Is a truth you'll find staring back<cf>from this world's utmost depths...
Hello, ser. ...Tell me, d'you suppose I'm doing this right? I've only been a few days at the job.
A merchant's paid me to mine here and send word if I find aught of value.
...But I've no eye for precious things, truth be told. You're welcome to explore the place as you like.
You will pay for playing us for fools!
How's the day find you?
Hold it here!
The captain at the Stone of the North seeks supplies? Very well.
I'll arrange for it at once. Know you what quantity he requires?
One week's supply.
Enough for training exercises.
'Twas left to your discretion.
One week, eh? Understood. He shall have his freight.
Pray, tell the good captain I'll add two days' supply to his request.
You have my thanks, Arisen.
One week, is it? Understood...
No doubt a bit more would ease their worried minds, mm?
Tell the captain I shall add two days' supply to the amount he requests.
Oh, and here... I should thank you to give him this.
'Tis hardly much, but I daresay it suits the palate better than dried rations. A gift for the men of the Stone.
I am grateful for your aid, Arisen.
Understood. He shall have his freight.
You have my thanks, Arisen.
I will see to the freight myself, Arisen. Pray, tell Ser Daerio that his wish shall be granted.
You need not worry further on the matter of Ser Daerio's freight. Provisions are being made.
Tell the captain arrangements have been made. Do not forget, Arisen: two days' further supply.
Assure Ser Daerio that arrangements have been made.
You've a stake in this, and a right to hear, ser. You know of Fournival, aye?
He is among the wealthiest of Gran Soren's merchants, though now he stands to lose all.
He is accused of a litany of crimes. I would beg a favor, if you've the time?
Accept
Not now
It seems Fournival was as busy in his underground dealings as in his honest work.
His bill of crimes includes bribery, fraud, abduction, the selling of secrets...
Even collusion with Salvation. The inquest continues as we speak.
Should the present tide prevail, he will like be found guilty and put to death.
Opinions are split, however, on the credibility of the present proofs and testimonies.
A few days yet remain afore the matter is decided. I ask that you go and gather what facts you can.
Any proof is welcome, be it evidence or testimony -- aught that clearly shows his guilt or innocence.
Justice must be done, and for that we've need of the truth.
I would ask you to seek out evidence in the trial of Fournival.
Material evidence, testimonies, witnesses... The more proof the better.
The inquest has but a few days remaining. I've faith you'll find the truth in time.
I see...
Well, Fournival was never entirely free of ill rumors. If the man is guilty, he must pay his debt.
Good, you've brought evidence.
Here. I shall see it submitted to the court.
There's time yet, ser. Pray, continue in your efforts.
Brought a witness, have you? Excellent work.
I shall see to the necessary accommodations until the day of the trial.
There's time yet, ser. Pray, continue in your efforts.
Word of Fournival's verdict has come. He was judged innocent, somehow.
The inquest ended without event, no thanks to your reprehensible indolence.
I will not brook such sloth in the future, ser.
Word of Fournival's verdict has come. He was judged guilty.
The inquest ended without event, no thanks to your reprehensible indolence.
I will not brook such sloth in the future, ser.
Word of Fournival's verdict has come. He was judged guilty.
'Twas a fair trial, and thorough. Justice was done, thanks in great part to your efforts.
I am not without pity for him and his house, but such are the wages of wickedness.
And for you, ser, the wages of diligence. Take it with my thanks.
Word of Fournival's verdict has come. He was judged innocent, somehow.
'Twas an acquittal hued in shades of gray scarce different from black...
But an acquittal nonetheless. The trial was fair, and so we must accept its decision.
Though the matter ended sourly, it's by no fault of yours. Take your wages with my thanks, Arisen.

Ngh!
Rrgh...
Aaargh...
Ha!
Hyagh!
How fare ye?
Fare well.
Aye.
No.
My thanks.
Mm, much appreciated.
Ey! Put me down a'fore I box your ears!
Gah! A bunch of ingrates, the whole village of you!
You all right, then?
Curious wounds, yours. Curious indeed...
I would beg you rest awhile yet, but just as like you'd turn a<cf>deaf ear.
Instead I ask only that you keep us in mind, now and again. 
Any wound a dragon delivers is likely to be grievous.
I pray it is not an omen o' ill tidings to come.
Well, first duty's to measure damage to the village...
Suppose we should be thankful. Dragon could'a roasted us all like fishcakes if he'd been o' the mind.
We lost some o' the menfolk... Good men, all.
But your sacrifice offered women and children escape... We're in your debt for that.
It will be some time before we face a second threat so dire.
But caution says we keep a heightened watch.
Take care walking the shore, minnow.
Talk is, the Brine have returned to feed...
Linger in the shoals and they'll drag you off.
First the dragon, then the pawns...
The old stories are true. No man can escape once the cycle starts.
The dragon arises and pawns soon follow, with a hero to lead them on a campaign o' glory...
It sounds like a cradle tale, something the minnows like to hear.
But that's how Duke Edmun himself got his start in life.
Tongues wag with tale o' the pawns, say they come when war is near.
Them poor husks are drawn to that encampment like moths to the flame.
Have you visited that encampment?
Best leave the soldiers to deal with them pawns. Naught but ill comes from the likes o' them.
Ha! I see your mind turn... Wonder why an old man knows the subject o' pawns. 
In truth, I speak little more than rumors o' old.
Some folks claim to have seen frightful shadows in the wood across from the encampment.
I've no word o' monsters in that region. Least, none of a size worth tellin'...
Yet it's enough to set my mind to worry. 
A hydra!? Oh my goodness...
It is a black day when such a creature slithers so near our hearth<cf>and home.
Always thought hydras and the like stuck to the Fetor in the west. 
Imagine you, routin' a hydra... And with the aid o' pawns, at that.
I say that makes you the true Arisen. If others wish to deny it, hang 'em and be damned.
Aye, the ancient tales speak o' the Arisen walkin' the land with pawns at their side...
Suppose you'll be leavin' us, then. Well, I warrant events will unfold as they will.
Poor Quina worries about you too much...
It's fear, you see? Fear that you'll go off to distant lands and find your end at the claws o' that dragon.
Returned from Gran Soren, then?
I'm sure word o' your deeds passed around that grand city, eh?
Once folks in the capital gather word o' the Arisen's feats, you'll be offered work from every corner, sure as sunset.
Mmm...
You've been my watch for many seasons, so I'll speak plain: It pains me to see you go.
But soft feelings from an old man are naught weighed against your duty.
We hear tales of you from every visitor.
The whole village swells with pride at each telling o' your deeds. And yet...
Well, don't mistake me, now... To a man, we're pleased you've taken up the mantle o' Arisen.
But we know you better than most, and care for you more than all. If we hesitate, it's only that worry stays our joy.
If your good work continues, even the duke will know your name 'ere long.
Peace, minnow. I would not keep you from your purpose, even if I could...
I ask only you choose your battles with care, and return to us when all is over.
This is your home, and we your family. Do you understand?
Damnable goblins been building up their forces along the western front.
Never would of dreamt it would be you what could drive 'em outta their stronghold!
I hear you met with the duke? And to think you were gutting fish on my knee, not long ago...
You know o' the duke's tale, yes? That he himself was Arisen, and laid the dragon low...
The wyrm could well spell the end of our entire world...
Defeat it, and they'll sing o' your deeds evermore...
Don't allow a thirst for glory to take hold of you. Ambition leads one into stormy seas more often than not.
The duke will ask more of you, no doubt.
But fare too well, and you become a threat in his eyes. Title or no, he's no more than a man...
Power corrupts all men... A truth as inescapable as the tide.
It's been long since last I set eyes on Quina.
She left with hopes to solve the riddle o' your wound, and we've not seen her since. 
You can't help but know the girl bears quite a fondness for you.
And no surprise. The two o' you, raised as kin and all...
Just promise an old man you'll protect and keep each other, come what may.
I wouldn't suppose you've seen Quina in your travels, eh?<cf>No, no...
Still, spare a thought for her now and again? She's near your sister, after all.
This world is much like the ocean: Great forces push on it... Pull on it... Ofttimes the only hope is batten down and pray for daylight.
Still, our corner is quiet next to the likes o' Gran Soren. I should give praise for small blessings.
So long as the dragon draws breath, none o' us are safe...
Times will only worsen till the beast is vanquished for good and all.
Your journey will grow yet more perilous from this point forth, I fear...
Story and song claim the death of the wyrm as the sacred duty<cf>of Arisen...
But I've a ship to sell to any man who holds story and song as truth.
None would hold you at fault should you not face the dragon.
If fate is to tell the wyrm as our end...so be it.
So Quina left, did she?
I told her you'd take care o' yourself, but she wouldn't listen, the stubborn pup.
I've no doubt she'll be back, and less doubt still she'll return with aid for your cause.
Wh-what? Quina is stolen away by the dragon!?
No... No... Merciful Maker...
Why? Why was I left alive to see this day?
Damn fate, damn prophecy, and damn the dragon!
Just what cruel designs move this wyrm, I ask you!?
Why take one the Arisen holds dear?
I'm...sorry. Forgive my words. I see they offer no use, save add to your burden.
Hold a moment, minnow. I'd have you know something:
Quina would support whatever decision, whatever action you<cf>take. Do you hear me in this?
None can know what it is to tread your path, and none will ever question your judgment.
Y-you confronted the dragon? And yet you stand before me! Your body still draws breath!
Tis a blessing to see you back. Yet... In truth, my thoughts of late fill me with dread...
I fear you are drawn into events far bigger than yourself.
Bigger than any of us all...
Why must there be dragons!? Why must an Arisen be cursed to fight them!?
...And why must it be you? 
I'm...sorry. Forgive my words. I see they offer no use, save add to your burden.
Hold a moment, minnow. I'd have you know something:
We support whatever decision, whatever action you would take. Do you hear me in this?
None can ever know what it is to tread your path, and none will ever question your judgment.
Even should it mean the end for us all.
The dragon is slain and Quina returned to us...
Our long struggle is finally at an end. I never thought to live to this day.
I...I cannot find my words.<cf>...It's not a feeling I've much experience with.
This I know: You saved our home, and our lives.
I'm certain mine won't be the final thanks you hear this day.<cf>You are the pride o' Cassardis!
You've done it! The dragon is slain.
Our long struggle is finally at an end. I never thought to live to this day.
I...I cannot find my words. It's not a feeling I've much experience with...
This I know: You saved our home, and our lives.
I'm certain mine won't be the final thanks you hear this day. You're the pride o' Cassardis!
Outlawed from the capital!? Hogwash!
Why in the Maker's name would they run off the dragonslayer!? You what saved us all in the hour of greatest need!?
...A great chasm? One that leads beyond the rift...
So the dragon means to lure you to the other side...
And nothing I say will keep you from that hole?
I'd sooner go to sea in a barrel than face whatever evil squats that place.
But peace, minnow. I'll not try to stop you.
This is your destiny, whether I ken it or no.
You've returned to us before and shall do so again. I have faith in this above all else.
I bid you safe travels, and remember: This place will ever be<cf>your home.
You'll have a home here with us always, come what may.
I'm certain mine won't be the final thanks you hear this day.<cf>You are the pride o' Cassardis!
Pray, pardon my asking, but are you come to aid the duke, ser?
We see so many warriors here to assist His Grace of late I fear my memory can't keep up.
Would that they were all like Ser Julien and Ser Mercedes.
Goodly folk, both, and you'll not find two more diligent workers, I'll warrant.
Some of the others are right scoundrels, though.
They'll break the duke's bread and drink his wine, then be gone again by morning.
It's that Salvation lot, isn't it? The ones staging this rebellion.
Just between us, I thought of joining them, once.
That was well before this revolt, mind. I went to one of their gatherings on a lark.
Surprised at the size of the crowd, I was. Hadn't expected nearly so many people.
Just because the dragon's awakened don't mean Gran Soren will fall.
There's work to be done in the meantime, and I aim to do it.
Returning to the manse, Arisen?
Too narrow, this bridge...
'Tis an open sewer runs below.
I hardly like the thought of<cf>falling into sewage...
Surely the duke can afford a wider<cf>bridge?
The path splits... 'Tis your<cf>decision, Master.
Which shall we take?
Not the stoutest bridge I've seen...
The bridge creaks underfoot...
Best not place too much weight upon it.
Hurry across, while it yet holds!
I do dearly miss the sun...
Damned beast!
Just my luck...
This looks grim...
Back! Stay back!
Grngh!
Waaaugh!
You there!
Don't stand there, help me!
Would you leave a man to die!?
Hey!
Well done, ser!
Aye, that's it!
Quite the fighter, eh?
That was far too close...
I'm called Reynard. A traveling salesman, though those damnable beasts ruined my wares...
But thanks to you, it was only wares I lost. I'll consider it a bargain. You have my thanks.
I fear this is all I've left to offer you. With luck, you'll find some use in it.
I'd best be off afore more appear... Hope to see you again, friend, once I've new stock!
I suppose I'll double back and take in new stock... With luck, we'll meet again!
Lookin' to bleed, are ye?
Bugger off!
What are you lookin' at?
Off with ye!
What is it?
I've naught to say to you.
If you've no business here, move on.
Best mind what you do here.
'Ow's the road treating you, cousin?
Come to join our little band?
Why are you here!?
Piss off!
Who d'you fancy you are?
You're not welcome here.
We don't suffer trespassers.
Eager to die, friend?
Be off with you!
You're daft, friend.
Have you naught better to do?
Still here, are you?
How do you fare?
Hoy!
Those rotten...
'Tis a poor jest...
...Truly?
We ought to have finished them earlier.
We'll do for them, we will...
Aye, we will...
What?
I see...
And what then?
Beg pardon, Arisen. I'm sure this is a small matter, but I would yet have you hear it...
I was at my post before the castle not long ago, when a strange man came 'round asking after your whereabouts.
Even more curious, when I told him I knew not, he swore me tell no one of our encounter.
Have you some enemy, Arisen? His eyes were...mad. I shall never forget them...
I beg you, be wary.

A strange trick of fate...to meet a fellow countryman.
So be it. Mayhap there is a new truth to be found in dragon's form...
'Tis the will of the world... Stand against me!
Graugh...! Yes!
The world calls out for a new ringmaster; earth and man and monster all. All are equal parts within the whole.

Erra, le fumanu'um.<cf>(Fall into disorder.)
Gather, raging flame!
Come, gath'ring storm!
Forget all you once knew!
L'glora, arda!<cf>(Destroying light!)
Which shall you be...? Man? Dragon? Or aught else?
Invalid Message
A shame, my countryman.
Viper! You colluded with Salvation to work<cf>sedition among the duke's men!
Salvation? You place me in ill company.
I am a man of this world.
Fantasies of death and redemption<cf>concern me not one whit.
Now, legends... Legends stoke up the masses.
If Duke Edmun were to best a second dragon...
Gransys would take the ascendant.
But her neighbors ill want a giant<cf>looming at their borders, am I wrong?
Spare me your sophistry!
The word "neighbor" sours on your forked tongue.
Our lands have long sworn unstinting aid<cf>to any neighbor beset by the dragon!
Unstinting, you say? Tell me, then...
Why has your lord father not sent your brother...
joined by Hearthstone's finest steel?
Why am I speaking, instead
with a bleating she-goat<cf>mocked even by her own men?
You will retract those words, ser!
Else suffer what consequence?
Else I shall wash my honor clean in your blood!
And you? You would play her second?<cf>I would welcome the challenge.
Stay out of this!
He's made an open mockery of me and my homeland!
This place holds nothing...only stillness.
The coming of your like is the sole exception. A moment's conversation, then stillness once more...
Aye! They say she understands Wyrmspeak, the dragon's own tongue...
Ngh!
Oof!
Aaaaagh...
Yah!
Hahh!
Hello.
If you'll excuse me.
Yes.
Well...
Thank you.
I could hardly be happier.
I could hardly be happier.
You're so kind... Thank you!
What have I done?
I cannot ask forgiveness for this betrayal...
But I was certain the duke would cut me down<cf>where I stood had I not spoken so!
You must run.
The duke is half mad and fearsome wroth.
I shall think of some way to assuage him.
Eeh.
Eaagh!
Aaaaah...
Ha.
Yaah!
Hello there!
So long, then!
Mm-hmm.
Hmm, no...
...Thank you.
You're so kind... Thank you!
You can talk to me later.
Ooh, go away, you pest!
Everyone's gone so serious... I s'pose it can't be helped.
Maybe it's boring, but I like it peaceful.
I wish that dumb dragon would die already.
...Did the Maker send the dragon 'cause I didn't do my chores?
I'm too young to die. It's unpossible!
Where...where'd everybody go?
You're so kind... Thank you!
'Tis a nightmare...
The master this pawn served lost her life here.
Yet I remain, alone... And for what? What ought I do?
Steel won't pierce its hide...? Then we are lost!
D-dragon!
Everyone, outside the village! 
Leave everything! Save yourselves!
Where do you suppose the boy's father<cf>has gone?
Gardenhands don't oft simply disappear...
We'd best hurry. For young Tomlin's<cf>sake.
The man worked in the castle...<cf>Someone here may know of him.
Perhaps he had acquaintances here in<cf>Gran Soren.
A worker imprisoned... Could it be him?
I pray I'm mistaken, but...was Tomlin's<cf>father imprisoned?
'Tis possible Tomlin's father was<cf>arrested.
Let's try the castle dungeon.
Only two ways into the dungeon: in<cf>chains, or in secret.
I pray we'll find a way in...
We can sneak in this way!
I recall a hidden passage into the<cf>castle from the slums.
We were careless... Next time!
Let's try again.
We must not be deterred!
There's a hidden passage nearby,
Tis a terrible shame... Would that we'd found<cf>a safer way from the dungeons...
Skeleton Keys come up for sale in<cf>shops on occasion, Master.
We'll like need two keys to escape the<cf>dungeon. Best find them beforehand.
Someone must know more of this.<cf>Let's ask around.
Shall we return to Gran Soren for<cf>now?
We can climb down here.
Masterfully done!
Our business here is finished.
In memory of Grette,
Silent-hearted, dragonforged.
With hair of gold and will of tempered steel.
You ransomed me from a village burnt to Ash--instilled life,<cf>and fight. Dearest mentor, I commend you now to rest eternal.
Your servant, bereft of master and memory,<cf>I keep now at my side.
She lives on, your mirror in soul and body both,<cf>and I will not lose her as we have lost you.
This I swear before your empty grave.
There's naught for it.<cf>Come, let's jump.
We're drawing closer... I can feel it.
These may offer some clue...
These may be the key to our path<cf>forward.
We've quite a few, but let's continue<cf>searching.
That should be plenty. Let's hurry on!
Seems the greater the beast, the more<cf>fragments it holds.
Where do you reckon we'll find<cf>these Wakestone Shards, then?
We've need of quite a few Wakestone<cf>Shards. Naught to do but search.
Just how many of these Wakestone<cf>Shards do we require?
We've gathered a fair number. At least<cf>half of what we'll need.
We've gathered the last of them...<cf>Now, back to the pawn we spoke to.
We've collected enough. 'Tis sure<cf>to open a new way forward.
We've need of a good number of shards. Best we<cf>set to searching...
Anh.
Aanh!
Eaaaagh!
Mm!
Hmmm!
He-lloo...
Come back and see me sometime.
Mm, yes.
Oh, no.
Thank you.
Ooh...someone knows how to treat a lady!
Trade your pawns for a real woman, lovely. I'll teach you things no puppet ever could.
...I'm having sport of you. I closed up shop, and none's the pity.
Don't need coin now. Not with the world ending.
Every day's a struggle just to make it to the next. That's life, for the likes of me.
A damned slow death, more like. Bit by bit, every day since the day I was born...
Truth be told, if the dragon's come to wipe clean the slate, I welcome it.
Long as I can recall, I worked each day and night just to fill my belly.
Hard work, too, for all the lying around. I won't say I never enjoyed it, though.
Day in and day out of naught but in and out and in and out...
Felt like time stopped moving, and not in the way a girl hopes, mind.
Each day, same as the last. Knowing the next would be no different, nor any after...
It's like I was caught on some endless spinning wheel. Always turning, never going anyplace.
If life is naught more than day after day of simply not dying, where's the point?
Truth be told, when I first heard the dragon had come, I was happy for the news.
Least this will bring some manner of change!
Mm? What, is this all, then?
I daresay I expected a bit more, end of the world and all. Folk disappearing and such...
Ah, well. A girl in my trade's used to disappointment.
Ooh...someone knows how to treat a lady!
Haslett devours every book you set before him. He's studied the dragon extensively.
I've never been much for reading, myself.
There are those who eye the Arisen with suspicion.
Perhaps the fault lies in those pawns you ride about with.
Within these walls you'll not find the prejudices of the outside, friend.
All the Maker's children are welcome here. Those bringing alms, doubly so.
Met with His Grace the duke, have you then?
He's a great man, aglow with the Maker's blessings.
The Faith is richer for having a pious man like him ruling the duchy.
Now if only he'd make the Faith richer with some of his coin, too.
Haslett's eyes take on a queer glow when speaking of the dragon...
Truth be told, we've been instructed not to.
Speak of the dragon, that is. Seems the Faith frowns upon it.
I've heard tell of one novitiate who grew too curious in his studies of the beast...
Word is, he was expelled from the Faith for his efforts.
Feels like now would be a good time to start praying in earnest, eh?
If the Maker sees fit to grant me a life after this, I'll spend it praying more sincerely...
That is, if the world doesn't end afore I get the chance.
Merciful Maker... Please... Please, no...
Ser, I... I know 'tis not a matter fit to thrust upon a passing stranger, but...
Please. I ask only that you listen a while... Just a short while.
Yes
No
Thank you, ser...
This child is... 'Tis my son. Was my son. His heart stopped not a few hours past.
Always weak, his sweet heart... Since he was but a babe. I had long known he would not live long.
But to see it... To watch him slip from my grasp... I am left with naught but rage at my impotence.
Fain to try any means that I might to bring him back, I looked to magick. Even curses...
Anything to bring him back to me... I know it for madness, but still, I...
Of... Of course. Aye, 'twas wrong of me to ask.
Even now, I... I cannot let him go.
Pray, will you listen a while, ser? I ask only for your time...
Yes
No
'Tis over... My son now sleeps within the earth, a stone for his pillow...
That which has died is dead evermore, I know. I know it well...
Yet still, I...
Here... Pray, accept these, ser.
The first of those stones I bought from a merchant my son and I passed in our travels.
He spoke of a powerful magick within it... Gather rocks such as this together, he said, and even the dead shall wake.
Not that I am one to blindly believe in such tales, mind.<cf>Yet, still... I thought there no harm in trying.
And so I searched. But by the time I found a second, the whole pursuit rang hollow...
'Tis a vain hope to seek immortality in such trinkets, I know. I felt a fool for having e'er believed it.
In my search, I've come to learn that tales of such stones as wake the dead are far from rare.
My son's condition grew worse... In my desperation, I scoured each passing town for any rumor or legend it might hold.
Some claimed the stones come from beyond the rift. Others caution that all hope of revival dies when corruption begins to take the body.
Another says the stones' power to call back the dead relies upon the strength of the wielder.
If that is true, there's little use in the likes of me collecting them.
But perhaps in the hands of one such as the Arisen...
No. Forgive me, ser. I fear I am well mad with grief.
That stone! You've gathered enough!?
Perhaps with those, my son... But I fear I've not the strength to conjure their effect.
Perhaps with those, my son... But I fear I've not the strength to conjure their effect.
A miracle... 'Tis a miracle!
Wilhem! Sweet Wilhem!
Words cannot express my thanks, ser. I owe you more than I can ever hope to repay.
You've returned my son to me... 'Tis the Maker's work you do, ser!
The world is truly blessed to have you, Arisen.
Aanh?
Away with you!
Pathetic dog! Keep away!
There is no place for you here.
Afraid the poor girls might hurt you?
Get out of my sight.
Why are you here?
You fancy you're better than us?
To the good life!
Hmm, you seem an able sort.
Pray, be watchful for pawns gripped by the blood lust.
They are mad with craving for it. 'Tis the only purpose they know.
Aye, Arisen -- well met.
We pursue a female merchant named Madeleine. 
She is charged by His Grace with trafficking in those queer medallions.
As a symbol of Salvation, the sale of such is blasphemy and treason both.
We mean to arrest her and uncover the girl's connections to the zealot's leadership.
We believe she is in hiding near here. Have you seen aught that might aid us?
Yes
No
No? We have reports she fled here...
After her!
With your leave, ser.
I'd hoped as much. We've reports of the girl in this area.
Don't let her escape!
Forgive me, ser -- duty calls. 
Quite the sight, that was. Though I s'pose it's the stuff of every day to you, Arisen.
I'd thank you to join me a moment.
Rather too kind, aren't you, friend?
Sparing his life will win you no thanks. Least of all from him.
Aye, he'll be around to stay your tongue presently.
I'd hoped you might assist me further, but I fear you lack the stomach for my work, friend.
I'll not have your conscience 'round my neck for a noose. Our partnership ends here.
Oh, it's you... Bugger off.
Hoping to be the next Edmun Dragonsbane, are you?
Better chances I'll grow a pair of teats.
More like than not you wind up food for the wolves long before you reach the dragon.
If you had a lick of sense, you'd go back to gutting fish in whatever dirty little hovel you crawled out from.
Grown tired of playing at hero yet?
Watch the dragon doesn't wake while you're still at this farce.
You might actually have to face it.
So the dragon's awakened.
I'm eager to be awed, Arisen.
Still here? Don't let worry stay you from the hunt.
We knights will keep Gran Soren safe should the beast dare approach Edmun Dragonsbane's keep.
Anh.
Aanh!
Eaaaagh!
Nh!
Eagh!
Well, hello.
Come again soon!
Aye.
No.
How lovely!
Ooh, thank you!
Welcome to Arsmith's alehouse, friend!
Come in from the road and rest your weary feet.
We've warm food and good wine, so come, come and be merry!
You'll find there's room aplenty, now the dragon's come and killed business!
You're an Arisen, yes? I've a sense for these things.
We've seen our share of Arisen come through, I can tell you.
Most were good, honest folk! I think the rest ran off without paying.
There's a way about your kind that's common to all, honest men or no.
A certain air, eh? That glint in your eye what says, "Leave it to me!"
His Grace has been through a procession of wives by now.
Still no heir, though.
There's rumors about say His Grace's steel is not up to the task.
How do you fancy that? Man can stab a dragon dead, but can't manage his wife abed!
We see a fair bit of custom from soldiers sent off to man the border strongholds.
I never saw a less eager lot. Unless you mean eager to dive into their cups.
Not that I blame them, mind. I pity the man what's ordered to stand against a dragon.
I've a mind to go back home before the dragon takes the capital.
I was born in the north, you see.
Came to Gran Soren on the trail of my lout of a husband. Bastard ran out on me.
Not that any of that matters a whit now, eh?
But speak of the northlands...
I hear Ser Mercedes is come to Gran Soren.
Last daughter of the lord of Hearthstone, that one. About my age, as I recall.
I'd given us all up for dead, but here we stand, alive and well!
I'm glad to see you've weathered the storm as well, ser.
How lovely!
We must put the safety of the others<cf>first!
They do not welcome our coming. Best keep<cf>our distance.
Then we will prove our will through action.
We've no other choice if we hope to win<cf>Maul's trust.
Thieves, Master! Watch for an opening,<cf>then strike.
Steel yourself for combat!
Careful, Master. They're strong.
They're breaking, Master! Steady on!
They ill deserved their feared reputation.
We've done it! Maul will be satisfied.
The thieves' hold is near.
Tis the domain of the western thieves.<cf>We'd best tread lightly.
Tis the home of the thieves of the west.<cf>Be ready!
Be ready for combat, Master.
Befriending the thieves will spare us a<cf>fair bit of bloodshed.
They'll ne'er trust us until we've proven<cf>our mettle.
Our target may well be holed up in a village<cf>nearby.
'Twas no easy choice... Let's back and tell<cf>Maul, then.
Perhaps some of the townsfolk nearby know<cf>aught of the traitor.
The man who quit the bandit gang... Where<cf>could he be?
Could the bandit traitor be here in Cassardis?
Perhaps the traitor thief is here?
We approach a den of thieves...'tis likely we'll<cf>see blood spilled.
There are thieves ahead, Master... If you aim<cf>to fight, I am at your side.
The wyrm is returned to the Tainted Mountain, as if in<cf>challenge... As if it awaits you there...
Hang her! Hang the witch!
Kill her! Kill her!
The rock moves!
Run! Run!
The village...
We've no hope...
Fall back!
Aaaugh!
'Tis locked. You haven't the key to fit it...
'Tis caught on something. Perhaps it could open from the far side.
'Tis barred shut. Might be able to break the bolt.
'Tis shut tight.
'Tis no use at this hour. You'll have to come again later.
Best stop for now.
Seems they're closed.
Someone was here...
Lost them...
Gone...
Perhaps you've upset them.
There's naught to do here.
Best you moved on.
Not here...
The door is closed.
Shows no sign of opening.
There's aught there...
You don't see anything.
That smell...
Someone's near...
What's this...?
Fine view from here.
There's aught written here...
Must be a way to find something...
Smells delicious.
Perfect spot to place something.
You can almost reach...
There appears to be aught ahead.
That fall could kill.
'Tis dangerous to touch.
A strong blow might break it.
Perhaps if you came by night.
Perhaps if you came by day.
Perhaps if you came at dawn.
Perhaps if you came at dusk.
There's aught buried here...
You see no way up.
'Tis slick, this spot.
No use pressing any further.
No need to double back further.
No time for that now.
You cannot carry any more.
There may yet be aught lying about.
Seems there's naught you can take on at present.<cf>Best to try again later.
Perhaps with a bit of help...
Best you kept your weapon sheathed.
Is someone here...?
'Tis a place for tall folk.
'Tis a place for small folk.
Had you a woman in your band...
Had you a man in your band...
Had you a strong companion...
Had you a swift companion...
Had you a magick user...
Had you an apt climber...
Had you a skilled jumper...
This weapon will not help you.
That armor won't protect you.
You're ill equipped for this.
Seems it can't be used now.
You'll get no further use from it.
'Tis useless, now.
Hmm, not with your current equipment...
Not with your current party...
You hear aught from further in.
Enemies... They're close.
Best you got some rest.
You can carry no more!
You're too exhausted!
"Danger! Keep Out!"
"No Trespassing"
A sign.
Had you an Empty Flask, you might fill it here.
You'll get no further without a lantern.
'Tis dangerous to fumble about in the dark. Best find a light.
Best not just leave them.
If aught were left here, it would rot.
Best take care you don't get lost.
Best check the map.
You're due for a rest.
This place is dangerous by night.
This place is dangerous by day.
Breathtaking...
You'll get no further!
Seems you'll need to come back.
Nothing left here.
It looks fit to crumble.
Seems it could be moved...
It will not budge.
It will not open.
Seems you need a key.
Seems you need a Pickaxe here.
You yet lack the experience.
You yet lack the skill.
Not with your current vocation...
You'll not pass through this gate.
You've no time!
Seems you were too late.
You may make it, yet.
You're doing well for time.
Seems you've come at the wrong time.
There may be another path.
The lever is missing. You have no use for it as is.
'Tis shut fast. The door bears a hollow that could fit something...
The monk's robes...and blood. 'Tis certain he's dead. Best go tell the other.
That monk's bloodied robes.
The device won't budge.
'Tis a powerful weapon... Too bad it doesn't work.
It will not open. Seems whate'er fits into the center serves as a key.
A lever is firmly attached.
Be wary near any body of water. Wade too<cf>deep and you might be enveloped by the<cf>fog-like monster known as the Brine.
Wander too deep or idle too long in the<cf>water and you'll fall unconscious, washing<cf>ashore later at some faraway place. 
A Ferrystone will spirit you back to Gran<cf>Soren in an instant, no matter where you<cf>are located.
It is by far the fastest and safest method<cf>of travel, but each stone disappears after<cf>a single use.
You can equip yourself with a primary and<cf>a secondary weapon.
Primary weapons such as swords and daggers<cf>are combat essentials. Secondary weapons<cf>like bows and shields offer support.
In addition to weapons and armor, you can<cf>also equip accoutrements with certain special<cf>abilities to give you an edge in battle.
Only one piece of jewelry and a single<cf>cloak can be equipped as accoutrements<cf>at any one time.
A heavy load will cause your Stamina to<cf>deplete more quickly. Sell or discard<cf>any and all items you no longer need.
Your lantern consumes oil. If it dims,<cf>use a Flask of Oil to refill it.
Some items can be combined with others to<cf>produce surprising results. Experiment and<cf>see what you come up with. 
Place waypoint markers on your map to<cf>keep track of your progress.
If you've forgotten where you are in the story,<cf>select "Chronicle" from the Pause Menu to<cf>review a history of your journey thus far.
Select "Options" from the Pause Menu to<cf>customize your mini-map and status display.
The higher the fall, the more damage you<cf>will suffer.
Note that you move somewhat slower while<cf>your weapon is drawn.
Exhausting all Stamina will make you unable<cf>to act for a time. Take care to conserve<cf>energy!
You can attack while clinging to foes.
Petrifaction cannot be cured by normal<cf>magick, and is fatal if left untreated.
Use Secret Softener or the like to<cf>cure any petrified allies.
Your rank within a vocation rises as you<cf>defeat foes and complete quests. At higher<cf>ranks, a broader variety of skills are available.
Defeating foes and completing quests earns<cf>you more discipline, boosting your prowess<cf>in a vocation.
Pawns will collect and use items of their<cf>own volition.
You cannot carry or purchase items that<cf>would cause you to exceed your maximum<cf>encumbrance.
Press <TUTO><SIZE 25><ICON TOUCH></SIZE> while climbing down a ladder<cf>to descend quickly. 
If a pawn remains unconscious for too long,<cf>they will be forfeit.
Your support pawn has become forfeit, and<cf>returned to the realm whence they came.
Your main pawn has become forfeit,<cf>disappearing and returning to the rift.
You cannot join covenants with other pawns<cf>while your main pawn is forfeit.
Touch any riftstone to return your lost<cf>main pawn to your side.
If a support pawn is forfeit, any items<cf>they were carrying are sent to item storage.
You can send off departing pawns with a<cf>single item as a gift for their creator.
You can pass items to and from your pawns<cf>on the sub menu.
It cannot be opened from here.
Why are you here!?
Piss off!
Who d'you fancy you are?
You're not welcome here.
We don't suffer trespassers.
Eager to die, friend?
Be off with you!
You're daft, friend.
Have you naught better to do?
Still here, are you?
How do you fare?
Hoy!
Those rotten...
'Tis a poor jest...
...Truly?
We ought to have finished them earlier.
We'll do for them, we will...
Aye, we will...
What?
I see...
And what then?
Lure of the Abyss
Barnaby begs of you to explore the Everfall, a<cf>sprawling ruin beneath Gran Soren. He claims a new<cf>"presence" has claimed the abyss.








Explore the Everfall
Delve into the Everfall ruins and seek out<cf>the "presence" Barnaby spoke of.



Report Back to Barnaby
Return to Barnaby and inform him of the light<cf>you witnessed in the Everfall.



Quest Successful
You reported your findings to Barnaby.<cf>Quest reward received.



The tower falls! Stand back!
Good day.
Decided, Arisen?
Understood.
I thank you.
I am ever at your service.
Good fortune be upon you.
Yes.
No.
I fear you haven't enough, ser...
Pray, forgive me.
My mistress oft said the Arisen ought give charity, but never take it... I am sorry.
Well met, Arisen.
With her dying breath, my mistress bade me stay here...
And so this pawn lingers, that the meager offerings I've collected may serve future Arisen on their path.
I am sworn to my fallen mistress to aid the Arisen.
This pawn shall assist you to the best of my ability, Arisen.
I pray you will see my mistress's dreams realized.
The hopes of my fallen mistress go with you... I pray you will be the one to grant her rest.

I'll have my vengeance, beast!
Hail, brother.
Naught to report?
Who is that!?
An impostor!
Then you would choose peace? ...That, too, is a valid fate.
Leave now, and you will never again come to see this place.
I don't reckon they'll just give up now that we're here, eh?
There's been no word from the men posted here in ages.
Hopefully the goblins haven't the brains to realize there's a ballista in there.
I can't believe this place fell.
I can't be quit of this place soon enough.
The guard is spread too thin to spare aid.
Retreaaat!
Pull back! Baaack!
We're ordered to turn back!
Run!
There! This way!
...The beast?
So close to the capital...
Cursed beast... Cursed world...
What... What's become of this land?
Ngh.
Gragh...
Waaaugh...
Hah.
Haah!
Hello.
Fare well.
Yes.
What? No.
My thanks.
I really must thank you, ser.
Sorry, but I've no coin to give.
Pray, do not make me wroth.
Something for your journey?
Good eye, friend.
Decided, eh?
No credit. You pay up front.
What do you say to this?
Right, let's have it.
This one, aye?
As you like.
I'm afraid not.
A cloud of unease hangs o'er the land these days.
Strong as you may be, you're still human. There's only so much one can do.
Who's a fellow to turn to?
What use is chasing after coin when the dragon's come to turn us all to ash?
Don't have the will for much of anything, truth be told.
Some tribute, eh?
Times like these you'd hope to see the duke take action.
Damn the monsters... Damn the lot of them.
What in the Maker's own name was that...?
I haven't a clue.
This is awful... Worse than I feared.
My thanks.

That's no mere wolf...
Pets of the goblins...?
They'll act as a pack.
Wolf pack!
Wolves hunt in packs.
Wolf! ...Alone, it seems.
They're swift as they are vicious...<cf>Take care!
They call more of their kind with a<cf>howl.
That howl is a call to other wolves!
Water doesn't affect them!
Slow their movements!
They cannot howl if silenced!
They're nimble. Watch your back.
Tis a chilling sound...<cf>We'd best silence it!
Howling...? This cannot bode well.
Certainly its pack draws near...
More of its kind are coming!
It seems water has no effect!
I'll dull its movement!
I'll silence its howls!
You'll not call your brothers now, cur!
Wolf!
A pack of wolves!
There, Master! Wolves!
A wolf! There!
Direwolf!
A pack of direwolves!
There, Master! Direwolves!
Master, a direwolf!
Hellhound!
A pack of hellhounds!
There, Master! Hellhound!
A hellhound, there!
Their bite is well troublesome.
They're a slippery target...
Don't allow them to surround you!
You'll ne'er hit them swinging blindly!
'Tis a trial to hit such swift targets!
That howl! It calls for more!
Silence that howl, ere more arrive!
It howls! Quickly, silence it!
'Tis larger than a wolf!
'Tis more bloodthirsty than a wolf!
'Tis more clever than a common wolf!
Keep well clear of those fangs!
They attack as a pack! Be ready!
'Tis nothing like the wolves we've seen!
Watchdogs of the infernal beyond...
Swathed in flames they're a greater<cf>threat!
'Tis effective to knock them back.
This place is home to wolves by night.
Even the roads are unsafe of late...
Watch for their lunges!
White wolves prowl this place.
We've entered direwolf territory.
Fire only urges them on!
Mind their fiery breath!
Beasts of flame, and strong...
Hellhounds, nearby!
We ill need more of them to come.
We're surrounded! Be careful!
Ice yields little effect...
They're quick, these dogs...
A white wolf...<cf>'Twill be red soon enough!
Its body is burning hot!
'Tis fast... Be wary, Arisen!
A black beast... 'Tis strong, Arisen.
Monsters, all round us...and strong.
Fire is bane to wolves!
Wolves fall quickly to flames!
An injured wolf, or...?
That wolf's hide is rot through.
Wargs!
Warg ahead!
A pack of wargs!
The curs fear a flame!
Their fangs bear poison!
Beware their putrid bite!
An enormous wolf!
That beast looks fierce indeed...
Garm!
Garm! Stand ready!
A pack of garm!
Thunder is bane to garm!
Strike at them from the flank!
Grabbing hold may at least slow them!
Shield your eyes! They spew a blinding fog!
Do not let them separate us!
There, Arisen. Garm at their feed.
A pack of massive beasts...
I cannot let you past.

An ancient text? What, again?
This much should be legible even to you, ser. That's "dragon," and "Arisen" by it. And there, "bond."
The rest is worn away and harder to read, but I'd wager that says "strength," while that "weakness."

Aye, I've heard of the party being gathered to slay the griffin.
Ser Georg and the others from the encampment are among them. The men who fought the hydra.
They're touted as elites, but the fact of it is they're mere sellswords.
The harshest tasks are often left to such types, or to the men of the Enlistment Corps.
'Twas but a short while we shared, but they were men under my command just the same.
I would gladly fight alongside them now, were it possible...
Alas, the duke has other use of me.
Arisen... I ask you in my stead. If you choose to join Georg and his men in this hunt...
Pray, see them back alive.
They are competent warriors, to a man, and not apt to die so easily...
But I would rest easier here knowing they march with the slayer of the hydra. ...Please, ser.
Pray, see them back alive.
I shall rest easier here knowing they march with the slayer of the hydra. ...Please, ser.
All of the men are safe? Truly, they owe you a debt, ser. As do I.
I regret I have naught to give you, but swear upon my name I shall repay you, Arisen.
I mean it true, ser.
I am greatly joyed to know a warrior such as you. One willing to fight for the sake of others.
I see... Even the Arisen could not protect them all...
Forgive me, I do not mean to blame you. The fault is mine for begging the impossible.
The task was difficult, and fraught with danger. Death is ever wed to war.
Still... I dearly wish I might have been there to fight alongside them.
Dead? All of them? ...Merciful Maker.
No, I... I do not blame you, ser. 'Twas a perilous task. Death is ever wed to war...
I must seem a farce of a knight to you.
Shaken so by the deaths of a few men she lead for but a handful of days...
Perhaps that is the truth of it. Perhaps I was never fit to lead...
A toast! To the Arisen!
I cannot fathom His Grace's mind in this...
I've no stomach for such gatherings...
Let us speak another time, ser.
Pray, calm yourself.
Well met, Arisen. We've been awaiting your return.
Waste no time on us, ser -- the duke awaits. I fear for the others in the castle, besides.
Though 'tis small mercy to be spared only to face this world...
Perhaps we'll all be wishing the earth devoured us ere long.
Come, Arisen...
Forge in my fire the next link in the endless chain...
Now, choose. Flee, or step forth...
Take hold of what lies beyond.<cf>Claim mastery o'er the eternal ring!
You were raised with Quina, were you not?
I would ask a service of you on her behalf.
Hear her out
Not now
Maker bless you, my child.
As you know, Quina is well devoted to the Church. She has distinguished herself here, in her studies and duties both.
So it is at long last that her fervent wish has come true: She is granted transfer to the Grand Cathedral in the mainland.
It is a great honor for our humble abbey -- we are aglow with pride.
We wish to bestow upon Quina a gift of blessed items, that the Maker may shield her on her journey.
But alas, we find ourselves without certain sacred materials required for the blessing.
As her friend since childhood, we can think of none more suited to gather these items.
I would also ask you hold this errand secret from Quina...
We hope to surprise her with the gift on the morning of her departure.
Oh? A pity... As her long-time confidant, this task is well-suited to you.
Might I beg your assistance as we prepare for Quina's departure?
Hear her out
Not now
The materials can be found within the Catacombs.
I understand these selfsame materials are readily available in processed form throughout our capital.
The gold required, however, is formidable. And we feel the task worthy of a more personal touch, besides.
I have no doubt Quina's desire to visit the Grand Cathedral owes much to your role as Arisen.
Acolytes of the Faith have long studied the dragon there; doubtless she hopes to discover some means to aid you.
Some call it folly to attempt the long journey to the mainland with the dragon about, but I disagree.
Knowledge is the light on our path to conquering this evil -- it must never be abandoned.
My thanks, Arisen. This is all we required. We shall begin the blessing at once.
May the Maker's light shine always upon you.
Well, Sister, the time is near.
Our time together has been short, and yet you have become so very dear to the abbey.
Nonsense, child! It warms my heart to send one of our own to the Grand Cathedral.
Afore you depart, I would have you take this: A gift, from all of us.
I pray Quina fares well...

Uh!
Ungh!
Eeaaagh...
Hah!
Haah!
Hoy.
G'bye.
Aye.
Naw!
Thank you.
Fantastic! Thank you!
Talk is, some hero fit to slay the dragon's come to Gran Soren!
That you, is it!?
Hmmm... I s'pose you've a tough look to you, that's true.
Still... Hmmm.
Mother always says it's a fool judges a book by its cover.
I say to that there's many a book what's pages hold exactly what you'd think from a look at the front.
You've managed a grand list of feats for one with your look.
Impressive, really. You've won a bit of my respect.
The world is dreadful dull, aye?
All full of fakes and fools claiming they'll be the one to save us all.
Nngh...
Why... Why did this happen!?
Oy! You! Was it you done this!? Is this your work!?
You... You've put the city to ruin!
Beast...! Devil!
Have you seen the pit? Some sight...
The place where our old home was is gone. All of it, just gone...
We'd all have died for sure.
Fantastic! Thank you!
Uh!
Ungh!
Wauuugh...
Hah!
Haaah!
Hello...
Goodbye.
Aye...
No...
...Thank you.
You are very kind... Thank you.
Man is a sorry creature indeed...
Able to grieve for my son, to feel the emptiness, but...unable to do aught to save him...
How arrogant to think we can save this world when we cannot save one sick little boy.
Speak to me not of dragons...
I shall never forget your kindness as long as I draw breath, Arisen.
We will live each day to the fullest, my son and I. Together, as a family.
'Tis the province of the Maker alone to measure the span of a man's life. I see that now...
And I see the Maker, too, for what He is. Merciless, and deaf to our prayers, besides...
I shall never forget your kindness as long as I draw breath, Arisen.
I've no drive to do anything more...
Not now I've lost my only son... My only kin.
Blessed Maker, my son sets forth to join you...
Pray, take him into your embrace as I cannot, and grant him peace forevermore.
'Tis the province of the Maker alone to measure the span of a man's life. I see that now...
...I've finally come to see the truth of it.
The Maker has no love for His children. Man is as the lowest worm to Him!
You are very kind... Thank you.

Do not let them from your sight, Arisen!
I've not seen a view that rivals it...
Gransys is rife with spots fit to steal one's<cf>breath away.
We failed to keep them safe... Words cannot express<cf>my regret...
Heh heh... Keh heh ha ha ha ha! What garden<cf>of strange delights is this?
What forgotten paradise? What font of endless diversion?!
The darkness! The stench of blood! We<cf>stand at the merry mouth of hell itself!
My beloved... I had hoped to leave this life<cf>held in your strong arms... Farewell.
Longevity can seem a curse when it means living to see such times.
Ahh, the horror... The horror of it...
What can one person do, truly?
All we can do is wait for the storm to pass.
Salutations.
Somewhere abundant with plant life would likely grow the herbs we seek.
Selene of the Witchwood deals in many an herbal tonic. Perhaps she knows aught?
Let's see these back to Arsmith.
Notices requesting work? Perhaps we should take a look.
What are we to seek this time, Master? Whate'er it is, we are yours to command.
Good work, Arisen. May the next task go as smoothly.
It holds the upper hand as long as it's aloft. Use the lay of the land.
Not now!
Rragh!
I'd hoped we might whittle it down further afore it flew...
Next time, we shall better focus our attacks. For now, we march!
Ngh.
Augh.
Graaaugh!
Hnh.
Hraah!
Heh, fine weather, aye?
No dying, now.
Aye.
Naw.
My thanks.
A light in the darkness, you are.
Aught you needed?
What'll it be, then?
We've naught but time, here.
A fine choice.
Till next time.
Hah. Tell me another one.
Are we agreed?
Leave it to ol' Barroch.
This one, wasn't it?
As you like.
Would that I could, friend.
Someone's looking for me? Then this pit is<cf>home to stranger folk than even I'd imagined.
An honest mistake, most like. I've been down<cf>here half an age, and not once have I known<cf>anyone to come calling.
Helping others is the Maker's work, friend.<cf>Why not leave it to Him and busy yourself<cf>with staying alive?
I'm not the sort to take directions, besides.<cf>I go where I please. We seem alike in that.
Well, this is a surprise. Can you just come and<cf>go as you please, then?
I'd thought everyone come to this place was<cf>lost to the world outside. Myself included.
Ah, well. It's the exception what proves the<cf>rule, or so they say.
My trade? Isn't it obvious? ...Heh, no, I don't<cf>suppose it is.
I'm a wandering scholar of sorts, and an Arisen<cf>besides, though I may not look like either.
In truth, I've left the wyrm hunting racket. A<cf>dangerous pursuit, and the rewards are meager.
But speaking of remuneration, I'll fain help you<cf>in your travels if you furnish the coin.
The poor fools drawn into this place all come<cf>singing the same tune, by and large.
Heroes, every one, the deluded fools. Sold on<cf>dreams of fixing this blighted world by kings<cf>and lords with their own agendas.
It's that, or the knightly types with their lofty<cf>lust for strength, eager to whet their blades<cf>with any foul creature they find.
I'll thank you to leave me out of either pile.
And which are you, then? What is it you hope<cf>to find here? If it's fame or fortune, pray, look<cf>elsewhere, friend. You have that luxury.
You must be well bored of your hunt to be<cf>wasting time in here. Or well confident.
Now, will you have a look? I'll see you don't<cf>regret it.
Till next time.
This little island and what lies beneath it are<cf>a pretty mess, don't you think?
I've done my share of exploring, and I'll aver<cf>this place appears in no map or text I've ever<cf>seen.
Even the halls that link one chamber to the next<cf>are mad. The work of some diabolic magick, like<cf>as not.
A place so steeped in rancor just begs for<cf>conquest, doesn't it? Gets my juices flowing.
One look around and it's clear we're rats in a<cf>trap here, friend.
But then, I'm a strange sort. This sort of welcome<cf>puts me more at ease than any hospitality.
Customers are another story, though. If you're<cf>buying, I'm all hospitality.
Good luck to you.
I was an apothecary, afore becoming an Arisen.
Made my coin mixing potions. Fusing reagents<cf>into new compounds. New elements. Alchemy,<cf>in a word.
This place is a trove of herbs and ores found<cf>nowhere else. Nowhere natural.
I've seen gold and jewels enough to rot my eyes,<cf>but the treasures this place hides ought keep me<cf>entertained for years to come.
The wandering life is sweet enough, once you've<cf>grown accustomed to it.
I'll speak no ill of others' dreams and duties, but<cf>I found my own oppressive, and a terrible bore.
If you've the need and the coin, I've the wares.
Till next time.
It's been many a year since I parted ways with<cf>my heart, and I can't say as I miss it much.
Were I still mortal, being stranded on this island<cf>hell might have caused me some bother.
Slaying beasts holds no allure for me.
And immortal or not, I've no time to waste on<cf>that which bores me. I'm content to spend<cf>eternity fleeing.
That is, until I've need of a fang or a wing or<cf>some such for a compound I aim to make.
In that case, Maker pity the beasties. I'm strong<cf>as the wyrm, when I can be bothered.
Rather cozy, this place. Save the perpetual<cf>darkness.
Care to see my stock ere you go?
See you again, friend.
That Olra girl is a strange one.
Why's she have you looking about for this friend<cf>of hers?
Most folk down here are would-be heroes eager<cf>for glory, or hollow husks who've ceded all hope.<cf>Either way, they're a simple lot.
The inscrutable ones like her are rare.
Forgive my nattering on. It's not that I'm bored,<cf>exactly. Just newcomers as game as you are a<cf>rare treat.
So, what'll it be? Aught you needed?
Cheers.
You can feel it, can't you? This place is<cf>wrought from the will of some creator.
I don't mean the Maker, mind. I keep no truck with<cf>the Faith. No, this place is like a memory given<cf>form...
We're guests in someone's imaginary world, you<cf>and I... Else rabbits in their snare.
Seems our host has a taste for hunting Arisen.
Best we were thankful we haven't all simply been<cf>cast into the abyss directly. Either he's the sporting<cf>sort, or he lacks a surety to his purpose.
Perhaps he's simply waiting for someone like you--<cf>a feisty challenger to come and unseat him.
Anything you needed, then?
Be seeing you.
Sent our host to his grave, have you? Heh, remind<cf>me never to cross you.
Still, seems these walls aren't about to come<cf>crumbling down for want of his presence.
Mayhap they've taken root in one material plane.<cf>'Tis idle conjecture, and of precious little import<cf>either way.
This place is without its master...and yet the<cf>beasts persist within it unabated. Strange, that.
Ah, well. I'll do as I will. They can do the same.
Care to browse my wares, friend?
Off you go, then.
You feel that? Something grievous dark is stirring<cf>within the bowels of the earth below us.
It bears the stink of the dragon... Worse, perhaps.
Just what have you gone and woken up?
Gold ill serves the dead, friend. Spend while the<cf>spending's good.
Stay alive, now.
Ever stopped to ponder just what manner of<cf>place this is, friend?
I say it certain that no such island existed off<cf>the land I came from. No record names it.
Though you need look no further than the links<cf>between this cavern's halls to know aught is<cf>amiss.
Nature bears no fruit so strange. We're guests<cf>in a world fabricated by someone or something.
To look at you, I'd wager you've seen it. Aye?
Had your tussle with the dragon, then espied<cf>the grand scheme of the world. How it's built.
Then you'll know the wisdom of leaving it all be.
Have you ever had cause to miss your heart?
Steer clear of cliffs and beasts beyond your<cf>means and you can live forever.
If wandering the countryside has lost its charm,<cf>take up residence here. I'd welcome a drinking<cf>partner.
You been hearing voices since coming to this<cf>place, friend?
Echoes of the dead, those.
Even the least of them what's fallen here was<cf>an Arisen in a former life.
Seems their wills were too strong to end with the<cf>body, and so they remain. Obstinate things.
It's a blessing they do more than just grumble<cf>and grouse. I'd go mad.
Where do the beasts here come from? You ever<cf>think on that, friend?
We're cut off from the world. Worlds. Whichever.<cf>It's naught but Arisen and pawns what come here.<cf>And that's when it hit me.
What if they're what's left of those fallen heroes?<cf>What happens to a soul bottled up in a place like<cf>this?
Some find peace enough etching their regrets in<cf>stone, but others... What if they just rot? Rot, and<cf>become darker things...
Just an idle theory, mind.
Mayhap we'll find out when I die and join their<cf>ranks.
If I run into you then, I'll expect a proper greeting.
You're far from the first new face I've come across<cf>here.
Most come bearing invitations, but I've turned the<cf>lot of them down.
No common cause. They fight to be quit of this<cf>place, while I find it rather cozy.
So I send them off with a bit of advice--worry<cf>less, and enjoy more.
The fact I haven't seen any of them again means<cf>either they got their wish, or got dead.
Either way, I'll not hold my breath for a reunion.
Clawing your way through the dark for days on<cf>end takes its toll.
Often as not, it's not the beasts that get you,<cf>but the crushing despair.
A man can be plagued by the voice of doubt<cf>anywhere, but down here the whispers are real.
You've heard them, sure, by now? Voices waxing<cf>fatalistic about the uselessness of it all...
I can scarce imagine the sort of grudge this<cf>isle's creator must bear against the Arisen.
Still less what I've done to earn my place here.<cf>I'm a simple wanderer. Keep to myself.
I've no illusions of entitlement as an Arisen. I've<cf>earned no one's respect and adulation, nor do I<cf>crave it.
But neither, surely, have I earned such retribution.
I wasn't the first to come here. It was a colorful<cf>cast already when I arrived.
An old man, half-dead by the time I met him. The<cf>other half didn't take long.
Another was a woman. Ahh, she'd have been a<cf>real gem, save that over-serious nature.
By the end, she treated me with the same<cf>contempt she would a beast.
Had she been freer with her charms around<cf>beasts, she might not have wound up serving<cf>as their supper. Still, a shame...
It's simple luck that I've survived this long. I've<cf>no illusions on that count.
Even in this forsaken hell, there's riftstones<cf>about to call for pawns.
Many are in disrepair, but the right price will<cf>buy them back to usefulness, it seems.
Convenient thing, that.
Mayhap this place is kindred to the other world<cf>the pawn legion speak of.
Either way, it's a thoughtful provision, aye? I'll<cf>have to thank our host, should I ever meet him.
Slay one pack of beasts, and another comes to<cf>pick their bones.
Like as not, a nastier breed than the ones before.<cf>There are times fighting brings more danger than<cf>safety.
I've lost good pawns to those scavengers. Damn<cf>near lost my head to a few.
If you aim to kill the creatures here, be mindful of<cf>the where and when. Don't get in over your head.
This place is full to the gills with scraps and<cf>materials unseen in the world I knew outside.
An alchemist's paradise, this. The smithy's work<cf>I do is the product of endless hours' trial and error.
But it's time I don't begrudge. My little obsession's<cf>half the reason for my wanderings.
Could be, the other half is running into strange<cf>ones like you, friend.
When I was made Arisen, I asked myself just what<cf>sort of role it was the world had handed me.
From the very start, I'd no interest in chasing after<cf>my heart. Useless thing.
If eternity was mine to pass as I saw fit, I'd pass<cf>it doing what I liked. That was my answer.
And what of you? You the type to buy into talk of<cf>duty and fate and all that?
I've stopped thinking about it, truth be told. Like<cf>as not, there is no real answer.
I'm hardly fit to say this, given how I've set up<cf>shop here...
But have you really nowhere else to be? No affairs<cf>more pressing?
I doubt you'll find any real answers carving up the<cf>creatures of these dark halls.
A light in the darkness, you are.
Now, will you have a look? I'll see you don't<cf>regret it.

We pawns have no true home, Arisen. But I ill wish to see this place destroyed, just the same.
I pray that you will guide us justly.
Urgent news, your Grace! A messenger has come bearing word from the Greatwall!
The hold has fallen to a man calling himself the leader of Salvation...
He's taken captives, and threatens to offer up a grand sacrifice to see the land cleansed!
I'll aim for the strongest!
I'll strike first!
I'll heal afore my wounds worsen.
I'll fight from safety.
I'll aim for injured foes!
I'll cull the weakest first.
I'll flank them.
I'll start with the most vexing.
I'll hamper the enemy.
I'll gather them together, then strike!
I'll hamper the enemy.
I'll gather them together, then strike!
Arisen, let me protect you!
I shall be your shield!
I'll shield you, Arisen!
I'll keep you safe!
I'll tend to the wounded.
I'll protect the injured.
There may be aught here.
I'll scout ahead.
I'll look for aught of value.
Gold, Arisen. I'll claim it.
Treasure, Master!
I'll look for curatives.
Curatives are nearby, Master.
I'll look for materials.
Useful materials, Arisen!
Our covenant ends on the morrow.
Our covenant approaches its end, ser.
At this rate, I fear our covenant<cf>will soon lapse.
If you cannot procure the rift crystals,<cf>our covenant will end on the morrow.
Our covenant will soon lapse.
This ends our covenant, Arisen.<cf>I await our next meeting.
I fear you have no rift crystals<cf>remaining. Our covenant ends here.
It seems you've no rift crystals left<cf>to offer. As such, I take my leave.
Farewell, Arisen.
I'll take on the strongest!
The toughest among them is mine!
I've my sights on their leader!
Felling their leader will strike<cf>fear into the rest!
Ignore the weak! They're a waste of<cf>time!
I'll cut a path to the leader!
Start by dealing with the easily slain.
Don't let the weak distract you!
I'll strike first!
I'll rid us of the weaklings!
I'll crush anything that moves!
I'll attack all those in my way!
Best heal a wound afore it worsens.
I'll keep myself fit to fight.
I'll join you once I'm healed.
I'll withdraw to heal for now!
Rrgh...<cf>...I must tend to these wounds!
I've no time for healing... Attack!
I'm...still fit to fight!
I'll need healing soon.
I'll stay out of the thick of things...
There must be somewhere safe to<cf>strike from...
I shall fight! ...Just, from a<cf>place of safety.
Healing can wait, attacking cannot!
I'm bled deep! ...No, I continue to<cf>fight!
I'll cull the weakest of the beasts!
I'll give the weak the mercy of death.
Let no fleeing beast escape!
You cannot escape me, fiend!
Leave the injured. Focus on the<cf>real threats!
No sense wasting time on wounded<cf>prey.
Let them flee.
Focus on those who challenge us!
I've no interest in injured prey.
I'll begin with the easiest prey.
Time to cull the weakest of them!
I'll weed out the weakest first!
Even the weak can be a threat...<cf>One I will deal with!
I'll flank them.
I'll loop around for a pincer attack!
I'll strike them from behind!
I'll take them head-on!
I say we charge them head-on!
I'll take them face-to-face!
Fight to the death!
Now, which of them will prove the<cf>most galling...?
First, to seal their ranged attacks...
Stopping their ranged attacks is<cf>highest priority!
I shall make them unfit to fight!
They'll be easy prey once I've<cf>hobbled them!
First, to impair the enemy...
Enough thinking! Attack!
No matter their status, I'll take<cf>them down!
Steel flies swifter than strategizing!
Less thinking, more fighting!
Gather them together, then strike!
Round them up and crush them all!
Gather them like cattle to the<cf>slaughter!
I'll give no quarter!
I'll strike the lot of them with<cf>all I have!
Into the fray!
I'll be the vanguard! Keep behind me!
'Tis too dangerous! Fall back, Master!
Worry not! I'll let nothing past!
Arisen! Let me heal you!
I shall protect you, Master!
I'll have you healed in a trice!
Stay strong, Master. I'm coming!
Leave it to me!
I shall take this fight! To safety,<cf>Master!
I am your shield!
I fight at your side!
Fall back, I'll heal you!
I shall keep you from danger!
Be prudent, Arisen...
Our comrade has fallen! I'm coming!
Cover me -- I'll aid our fallen ally!
I'll aid our ally!
Hold fast, friend! I'll aid you!
I'll heal our wounded!
Use me as your shield!
I'll guard our wounded!
No harm will come to my comrades!
To safety, friend! I'll take the lead!
I'll see our comrades suffer no harm!
I'll protect our most vulnerable!
I'll bolster our defenses!
I'll draw the enemy's attention!
Who knows what's ahead? I'll take<cf>point.
Something grand may lie ahead...<cf>I'll go and see!
I'll scout for anything of interest!
I'll go and see what lies ahead!
There may be aught ahead. I'll have<cf>a look.
I'll scout up ahead.
I'll nip ahead and take a look around.
Let me check the path ahead.
Wonder what's around here?
Leave the scouting to me.
I'll have a look up ahead.
I'll keep my eyes forward.
If there's aught of value, I'll find it!
Leave the treasure hunting to me!
Gold! I'll get every last coin!
Money before monsters, I always say.
A chest! I'll just have a peek...
You do the fighting, I'll grab the coin!
A chest...I must know what's inside!
Coin, Master! Waste not, want not,<cf>after all.
One can never have too much gold.
Every bit of coin counts!
Ahhh... there's something about opening a treasure chest.
I'll gather that gold, Master!
I'll fetch us that treasure.
Ooh, coin. Since it's here...
Spotted a treasure chest!
One can never have too many curatives.
I'll keep us stocked in curatives!
Leave gathering curatives to me!
I'll find us more curatives.
I'll make sure we've plenty of food!
Can't wage war on an empty stomach,<cf>Master!
I'll keep an eye out for curatives.
Curatives are important! But worry<cf>not, I'll keep us stocked.
Thank goodness we've enough<cf>curatives...for now, at least.
I'll make certain we're prepared<cf>for the worst.
No harm in taking any curatives we<cf>come across.
Curatives will be useful...<cf>I'll gather what I can.
I'll find us some food.
I'll seek out curatives.
I leave combat to you. I'll search<cf>for materials!
I'll scour the area for materials.
I'll look for materials we can use later.
I'll see that nothing useful goes<cf>to waste!
I'll gather any materials I find!
Too many materials? There's no such<cf>thing!
'Twould be a shame to overlook good<cf>materials.
Best gather these materials for later...
No sense letting good materials go<cf>to waste.
Might as well take these with us.
These materials will most certainly be of use later.
If materials are around, I'll find them!
I'll find materials.
Good day.
Good evening.
I thank you.
How may I serve?
Something amiss?
Hoy!
It has been some time!
Well, I trust?
'Tis a pleasure.
May our paths cross again.
Do you remember me, Arisen?
We have traveled together before.
It seems we're bound by fate's<cf>strange thread.
It is good to travel with you once<cf>more.
It has been some time, Master.
Fate is strange, is it not, Master?
I had hoped our paths would cross<cf>again, Master.
This pawn is pleased to see you<cf>well, Arisen.
Best visit the rift first.
I fear we cannot yet join a covenant.
'Twas well worth the effort!
This pawn stands proud of what we<cf>accomplished.
This pawn is joyed to hear it, Master!
I'll strive harder still the next time!
I'd hoped to serve you adequately...
This pawn shall take greater care<cf>the next time.
I see I've much left to learn.
I served as best I know how...<cf>My apologies.
We mustn't allow its blows to land!
It flees!
Now, attack! Let's finish this!
'Tis a troubling foe!
Strike the head!
Strike the flank, or from behind!
We've need of antivenin.
Best stay wary of ambush.
Shall we leave it be, Master?
Focus your blows upon its head!
I'll focus on its head!
Watch for attacks from above, Arisen!
Now! Strike!
Quickly now! Have at!
From behind!
I'll add lightning!
We're targeted!
I've been made a target!
Incoming!
Dodging!
Look out!
Best evade that attack!
Must dodge...!
Defending!
I'll absorb the blow!
Here it-- Defend yourself!
I can give as good as I get!
I'll answer this blow!
I'll counter!
The terrain here can harm, sure as any<cf>blade.
The land itself is our enemy here.
A toxic place!
Beware the flames!
Look sharp -- don't test your<cf>flammability!
A lantern would serve.
I'll ready a light.
Shall we have a light?
Ah, yes, that will serve.
'Tis enough light to navigate.
I'll douse the lantern.
Best put out the lantern.<cf>'Tis a waste of oil.
We've light enough here.
Our lantern has run dry.
We'll be needing more oil for the lantern.
Well done!
Sharp work!
We've done it!
Whew... 'Twould appear we've won.
'Twas a formidable foe, indeed...
Made it by the skin of our teeth...
'Twas an exhausting battle.
A pitched battle, that.
'Twas over before it began.
Our foe was doomed from the start.
Hardly worth the effort.
No surprises there.
Be healed!
I'll heal us all!
A healing spell, for all of us!
Be invigorated!
Be free of your ailment!
Heal now, while we can!
Shall we heal, then?
I must heal at once!
My thanks!
Master, you have my thanks!
As you wish.
Forgive me for straying so far.
Hold on, I'll be there shortly!
Apologies, Master! I'll return at once.
Are you all right, Master?
Pray, know your limits, Arisen...
Thank you...
Many thanks, Master.
Awaken!
To arms!
It begins!
I'll take them all at once!
The entire group will fall!
I'll ensnare the lot of them!
You've my support.
I'll create an opening!
I'll restrain it!
I'll gather our foes!
Fiend! Here!
Come! Your end awaits!
Fight me! Fight me, if you dare!
I'll infect 'em with an ailment!
I'll debilitate 'em!
I'll weaken 'em!
This ought bolster you!
Gather up, friends! I shall empower you!
This calls for potent magick!
I'll prove magick's strength!
This ought finish it!
I'll seek its weakness!
Firing!
I'd best get into range.
I shall lure them!
I'll serve as a decoy!
I'd best bolster my defenses!
Nothing can touch me!
I shall not falter!
My defense is perfect!
Just try to harm me!
Here I go!
Perhaps I can steal aught of use.
I'll see if I might pick a pocket or two.
This one may carry something valuable...
Magick, protect me!
Wall of protective magick!
No...! An ailment, now?
Augh... Debilitated!
I've been stricken...!
My own will...it's fading...
I'm losing...control...
Keep your distance, Master...<cf>I am not myself!
My eyes... My eyes!
...All is darkness!
I'm blinded! Where is the enemy?
Ergh! I'm spent!
I...I fear I've no energy left...
I'm exhausted...!
I'll take to the air!
I sense something...
Master, a foe draws near!
A monster! Your orders, Master?
Careful, a monster is near.
Arisen, an enemy!
Something small is near, Master.
Arisen, a massive foe draws near.
Master -- in the sky!
Look sharp...monsters are near.
Be careful, Master...
'Tis a dangerous foe we face.
A perilous beast, this.
That's no easy foe...
'Tis a formidable monster, Master.
Ah, a monster.
I've not seen one of those before.
Prepare for battle!
Steel yourself for combat.
Hold, Master.
I'll go on ahead, Master.
I'll take point.
I'll bring up the rear.
I'll protect our vanguard.
I do feel a bit worn...
My strength is flagging.
I've need of rest.
I could do with a spot of healing...
...Master?
Arisen? ...Is anything the matter?
Wha--? What are you...!
Master!? Where are you taking me?
P-please, put me down!
What-- What are you doing!?
Ah...ow! Master!?
Master, please -- unhand me!
Oy!
Ngh!
Ow!
Why? What was that for...?
Have I given offense, Master?
Please, enough horseplay...
I do not appreciate such treatment...
I'll have a look around.
Perhaps there is aught nearby.
I'll check the area.
There may be aught here... Let me see.
Nnnnngh...
'Tis been a long journey...
Hmm...
What to do...
Let us proceed, Master.
Come, Arisen.
Greetings, fellow soul of the legion.
This pawn is yours to command, Master.
Ah, wonderful...
You have my thanks, Master.
Using this should help.
This will serve.
I'll heal all our wounded!
Everyone, be healed!
This'll restore a bit of health.
A curative will serve.
Ah, well and good, yes.
Refreshment is in order.
I'm desperately low of stamina.
Ah, refreshing.
I'll neutralize the poison.
This will draw out the toxins.
There. Suffer the poison no longer.
I'll end your slumber.
This will snap you awake.
There. Asleep no more.
I'll dispel the ailment.
And your ills are cured.
This may help...
Here, make use!
Ha ha! Yes! Into the fray!
Come, fiend, let's have your best!
I shall strike first...and fast!
I'll keep us healthy.
We must move cautiously.
I'll start with our feeblest foe!
Leave the weakest to me!
Best approach with a strategy in mind.
Let's begin with the stoutest.
I'll start with our most<cf>formidable foe!
I'll fell the lot in one go!
Let me weaken 'em!
I'll inflict an ailment!
I'll act as your shield, Arisen!
You are safe with me, Master!
I am here for you, Arisen.
I'll protect our allies, Arisen.
I'll tend to our party's needs.
I'll scour the way ahead.
No need to rush after me.
I'll take what I may...
I'll claim all I can.
Mm, I feel a shift in my disposition.
Aye, now I see this world with new eyes.
I've found something.
An item, Master!
Ah, what have we here?
Mm, I'll take this.
Let's clear the way.
Need to get this out of our path.
I'll deal with this.
Let's see what's inside.
Anything of value here?
Take this!
A present for you, fiend!
Let's have a look...
Rather precious, this. I'll claim it.
Aught of import, like as not...
'Tis a rare item indeed.
I'll take this for you.
I'll collect what I can here.
I'll see what I can harvest.
A trap! Mind your step...
A trap! Watch yourself!
I'll free that trapped soul.
That prisoner needs our help!
Master, that poor wretch is trapped!
A spring... A quick dip might soothe our<cf>wounds.
A healing spring! We ought to <cf>take advantage of its benefits.
I'll put some in a Flask for later.
Let's take some for the road. 
So this is what conjures the fog...<cf>No longer!
This is the source of the mist?<cf>Not anymore!
There, the cause of this fog.
Pray, this talisman's destruction take<cf>the fog with it!
I'll open the way!
It holds an item, like as not.<cf>Let's have it open.
Surely aught of value hides inside.
I'll see what's inside.
Perhaps aught lies within.
One less lizard to contend with...
I'll step on it.
I'll try boarding the switch.
This floor panel must activate<cf>something...
Well done.
Masterful work, Arisen.
We work well together, Master.
Yes! Excellent teamwork!
A superb tandem attack!
'Tis too much... We'd best reconsider<cf>our party makeup.
Training oughn't be this hard...<cf>Mayhap our party is misbalanced.
This is training!? ...Perhaps a<cf>change of allies would serve.
We'll never survive continuing like this...
The makeup of one's party can oft tilt<cf>the outcome of battle...
Now's the time to strike!
Yes! Now's my chance!
Yes, at once.
I'll go at once.
I'm on my way.
I obey.
Certainly.
Understood.
Consider it done.
Very well.
As you wish, Master.
It will be done.
Yes, right away.
Recovery, coming up.
Yes, I'll search.
Certainly. I'll have a look.
I'll scour the area.
At once!
By your command.
I will give my all!
Oh...er, me?
Er, just a moment...
I... Are you certain?
Ha! I was hoping you'd ask!
Leave it to me!
Of course!
...Very well.
Indeed...
...Fine.
Yes, I'll handle it.
Agreed. It must be done.
I know what to do.
I...I hope I'm up to it.
I'll try not to fail you.
I will...do my best.
Very well... If I must.
Don't worry yourself, then.<cf>I'll handle it.
If you insist.
I...I've had quite enough of battle.
Master...perhaps next time we might<cf>avoid fighting altogether...?
I...I'll have nightmares from that one...
Hah! Is that all you have for me?
Our strength brought us victory.
Onward, to our next conquest!
Whew...
'Twas simple enough.
...Interesting.
I only hope we survive the next<cf>encounter...
I didn't expect to survive, to be honest.
'Twas sheer luck that saw us through.
'Twas a fine scrap, if I may say so myself.
If only we could fight something<cf>that posed a challenge for once.
That's all? Barely worth the effort...
My...
It'll take more than that!
Not this pawn, not this day...
I can't stand much more of this...
We...we fight even still?
...Much obliged.
How shameful...
'Twas but a scratch...
No need to concern yourself for the likes<cf>of this pawn.
I am deeply sorry...
I vow it will not happen again.
I shall wear my scars as trophies!
Perhaps 'tis time to get serious.
Master, are you unwell?
I...hope this helps...
It only gets tougher from here,<cf>Master!
I'll take care of that for you!
...Can you stand?
...You'll be fine now.
'Tis hardly befitting an Arisen.
Wounded by this trifle? Please,<cf>Arisen, don't be so careless.
Please be careful, Master.
There is no need to be reckless,<cf>Master...
Ah, where would you be without me?
Just leave yourself to me, Master.
Ah, Master, you're back!
We must carry on, Master.
If you fall, Master, what hope have the<cf>rest of us?
This pawn would be lost without you,<cf>Master.
'Tis naught to be ashamed of!
We've only just begun, Master!
...Let us proceed.
Even the Arisen can err, Master.
No use in dwelling on failure.<cf>Back to the fray!
I do not relish the sight of you in such<cf>peril, Master.
It's my carelessness what caused this...
Sure you've made a mistake or three...<cf>Don't let it get you down.
I will come to your aid as many times<cf>as necessary.
Oof!
Ngh!
Rrgh!
Eep...!
Ow!
I...I'm done for...
I can still fight...
How pathetic...
Can't believe this...
Ngh...
...Bah.
I was careless...
After this...comes the fun part.
Hmph! 'Twas nothing!
'Tis but a flesh wound!
I do not like this...
I fear...defeat is at hand...
This... This cannot be...
Well, well, a fair surprise, this...
Ah, so that's the way of it...
Danger is part and parcel of<cf>adventuring...
Flame has no effect!
Ice is futile!
Lightning does nothing!
Dark magicks have no effect!
Holy magicks do nothing!
Blunt strikes are ineffective!
Slashes are ineffective!
Impacts are ineffective!
I shall force it to slumber!
Be petrified, fiend!
So weary...
Is this...oil? 
I've been covered in oil...
I've been drenched...
Soaked to the bone!
My strength...fails me...
I have been badly cursed... 
I turn to stone--!
Am I to become...a living statue...?
I--I'm on fire!
How did I perform?<cf>I tried my hardest...
I brought this back for you.
I hope I was able to please you, Arisen.
'Twas quite a learning experience.
I learned of many different beasts.
I've quite a haul to bring back<cf>this time!
It isn't much, but please, take it.
What do you think? 'Twas in fashion beyond the rift, but...
Indeed, my old kit was best.
I'll trust your judgment, Master, and stay as I am.
We have triumphed!
Strength in numbers, Arisen.
Perhaps we could avoid further battle...
That was hardly a warmup!
That's all?
...Mm.
What else would you expect,<cf>with my help?
There's no way we could have<cf>lost to that.
Are you unharmed, Master?
It seems we've won...
That was a waste of time.
I was about to give as good as I<cf>got, too!
I was unprepared.
I suppose I went too easy on it...
It seems we've actually found<cf>a challenge.
Hold on!
Don't worry, I am here.
Please don't overdo it.
Please be more cautious...
You cannot leave such an opening.
Don't be careless, Arisen.
'Tis still too early to admit defeat.
Up and at them, ser!
...Take more care.
Don't overdo it.
Master!
I have you now.
You'll be fine so long as I'm here.
Can you move?
I'll come to your rescue as often<cf>as it takes.
You need help again?
Come on, up you go.
S-strong...
Not bad... That actually hurt.
G-going!
I am off.
Here I go...
Coming!
As you wish.
Certainly.
As you like it.
This looks interesting.
I'll take that.
This may be of use.
What's this?
I've gained quest knowledge.
I feel more familiar with this<cf>quest now.
I've learnt what to do in this quest.
I've learned of beasts.
I've learned new techniques<cf>against that foe.
I've learned of this area.
'Twill be easier going searching<cf>this area now.
I feel familiar with this area now.
I've learned the contents of this book.
I shall restore your Health, hold on.
Leave it to me.
Anytime.
I'll heal your wounds.
Hm? What's that?
I wonder what's inside.
Treasure, perhaps?
We were fortunate.
It is over.
We'd best prepare for the next<cf>challenge.
Don't be careless... Let us continue.
We made it.
Have you ample curatives?
I shall take on the strong!
I'll begin with the strongest.
The first strike shall be mine!
I'll leave the weak foes to you.
Think well before striking
Do not just attack blindly.
Find an opening, then strike!
Just wait, we'll see a weakness.
I'll take care of the weak.
Leave these to me.
No interruptions!
I'll get the weaklings out of the way.
Ugh... I'll take them.
I'll take down the most troublesome<cf>of them.
Ranged attacks...
The ranged ones are mine.
I'll support you!
This should change the stakes...
Now we'll gain the upper hand!
This should quiet them!
Any that would target the Arisen<cf>are mine!
Insolence!
I will protect you, Arisen.
Arisen, I am at your side.
I'll protect my fellow pawns.
I'll give aid.
I'll not allow harm to befall<cf>my allies!
Any that would target a pawn<cf>are mine!
Let's see what we have here...
Heading out.
Leave it to me.
I'll well search the area.
That item is mine.
Nevermind the beasts, I'll take<cf>the loot.
That looks promising...
You battle, I'll take this...
...The hell're you doin' here?
Get outta here!
What was that? You want a beating?
Step away before I smack you in the face.
Who said you could talk to me, anyway?
So, you DO want to die!
Go. Away!
You're batty as a belfry!
Do I have to pay you to go away?
You again?
How goes it?
Yo!
Those bitches...!
This is ridiculous!
No way!
Best to have slaughtered them long ago.
They'll get theirs...soon.
Aye, we will...
Hmm?
Ahhh...

The flow of time holds little meaning to my kind, and still less, here.
For what is day, in such a place? Or night? Time here lies still.
The goblins will pay for what they've done.
We can only pray that the men inside still live.
The Stone's ballista will do a fine job of keeping us out of our own hold if given the opportunity.
How could they have bested this fort?
I'm eager to be quit of this place and back to sentry work in the capital.
We cannot hope for reinforcements...we ARE the reinforcements.
All glory to the duke!
Seems we can advance through here.
Each hall looks like the next... I fear we'll<cf>soon be lost.

No doubt you're aware the roads are ever more overrun with beasts of every stripe.
The threat has only worsened since the dragon's coming. Trade has suffered, citizens have died.
A company of the land's finest sword hands have been gathered to thin the creatures' numbers.
'Tis no perfect solution, but it is a start. I would ask you to join them, ser.
Accept
Not now
There's been no end of reports from caravans bearing tribute bound for Gran Soren waylaid by monsters.
Among them, the direst threat is posed by the griffin.
'Tis not a creature easily quelled, but we can ignore it no longer.
Hence the company of elites. And now it seems they are prepared to face the beast.
They stand in wait outside the castle gate. Go and speak to them for the details.
I fear this may prove a long battle, ser. May the Maker be your shield.
You'll need to work in concert with the others to rout the beast for good and all.
I do not doubt your strength or valor, ser, but do not let thirst for glory spur you to act alone.
The creature you face has already claimed many a knight. Pray, do not let down your guard.
Escaped to the Bluemoon Tower, has it? Then it will have a scenic death.
Muster your strength, prepare as you must, then finish the beast. Your duty awaits, ser.
Take what time you need to prepare, then. The others shall await you.
For their sake, and for that of all Gransys' people afraid to walk the roads, pray make haste.
Slaying the beast what stalks the roads will take nimble thinking and a steady arm in equal measure.
'Tis a task I would not entrust to any other, ser. The peoples' safety hangs in the balance.
Accept
Not now
Welcome back, ser! Then the griffin is defeated?
Blessed relief, that. All who walk Gransys' roads will rest easier for it.
'Tis welcome news, too, for trade.
You and the others who fought have my thanks, Arisen.
Nrgh!
Yow!
Eyaah...
Hah!
Yah!
Well, hello!
See you when I may!
Right.
I don't think so.
Thank you.
Oh... Oh, thank you so much!
Won't you have a look?
A fine piece, Arisen. Very fine.
Right away!
You haven't the gold now, have you?
I daresay you'll find this more than reasonable.
Thank you.
Here you are.
Very well.
That will not do.
This is for me? Oh...
Then I... I am...special to you?
I... I don't know what to say...it's a wonderful gift. Wonderful! For true!
I treasure you above all else in this life. ...Truly!
I suspect this is the start of a grand friendship...
And 'tis a fool doubts a woman's intuition.
Well, I've preparations to make, and a long road ahead to Gran Soren.
Fie! What to do, what to do...?
If only there were some hero to aid a poor, unfortunate lass such as I!
I find myself unable to do business in the countryside any longer.
The people speak of naught but the dragon, and fear draws their purse strings tight.
It's all I can do to hold the tears at bay, I tell you...
Hee hee! Oh, we...we meet again! You remember me, yes? Of course you do!
What, me? Drunk? How dare you, ser! I was... I was merely...having a conversation in the tavern!
It pays to pay heed to local rumors! One never knows when a loose tongue might drop a...profitable hint. Hee hee!
Ah, I haven't seen you in a while...
Saw to my own needs in the end. As ever.
I pride myself on many things -- among them is a fine memory.
And I recall hearing your oath to visit my new shop in the capital. You remember too, eh?
In truth, I half-suspected you to renege, and yet here you stand, in the flesh.
So, well...welcome! Welcome to Madeleine's shop!
Time is a funny thing.
It seems only yesterday you smuggled me from Cassardis...
Those were hard days, for a certainty... Survival was not a given, let alone with such grace and beauty as I managed, hmm?
Now here you stand, a full-fledged Arisen, and no mistake.
And me, for my part, a shopkeeper of no small renown.
We've both taken up the mantle, eh? You and I.
Yes, well, enough idle chatter. To business, then?
A girl must take what advantage she can. Don't you agree?
How good to see you again! You remember me, yes? Madeleine? ...Yes?
I hear you've become, what was it... A... Arisen!
Important, aren't you now? Such a post must come with benefits, mm? Gold and jewels and the like?
For myself, I aim to put down roots in a shop of my own. 
Many fled the dragon never to return, so good land is both plentiful and cheap. 
You must think me mad, to open a shop amidst this madness with the wyrm.
Perhaps, perhaps...but I say, examine it from another view.
Rather than grumble on how few goods I possess, think 'stead on how much remains! 
So, well... You're buying something, yes? Else would you not be here, hmm?
Yes, well, enough idle chatter. To business, then?
Yes, well, enough idle chatter. To business, then?
Hee hee! Oh, we...we meet again! You remember me, yes? Of course you do!
What, me? Drunk? How dare you, ser! I was... I was merely...having a conversation in the tavern!
It pays to pay heed to local rumors! One never knows when a loose tongue might drop a...profitable hint. Hee hee!
But, one moment... Did I not...
Ah, just so! You lent me a tidy sum as I fled Cassardis!
In truth, I don't recall the exact figure... But worry not -- I shall repay you with all speed! ...Just as soon as my shop turns a profit.
I may enjoy the jingle of coin more than most, but I'm not one to ignore a debt.
A knightly customer? Oh, we get all kinds in here, Arisen, but how is it your business?
Surely 'tis not jealousy steers your questions? Oh, fie! You needn't worry on that account!
I have eyes only for the purses of any what pass through that door.
That knight comes here with some regularity.
He asked the names of those who purchased the rare medallions I came upon not long ago.
His reward was impressive to say the least.
I speak of money, fool! Not...other things! Fie, but your jealousy is a thing to behold.
Yes, well, enough idle chatter. To business, then?
A girl must take what advantage she can. Don't you agree?
Yes, well, enough idle chatter. To business, then?
Hee hee! Oh, we...we meet again! You remember me, yes? Of course you do!
What, me? Drunk? How dare you, ser! I was... I was merely...having a conversation in the tavern!
It pays to pay heed to local rumors! One never knows when a loose tongue might drop a...profitable hint. Hee hee!
Was there aught I'd asked of you? It's been so long I've forgotten.
Yes, well, enough idle chatter. To business, then?
These are dark days, so terrible as to drive even I to the brink of tears.
But you've come to shop, not hear me prattle on! Let's to business.
In honesty, this shop is not quite mine for true.
When the previous owner fled the dragon, I agreed to purchase at a fair discount.
But even that price is more than my pocket can bear, so we're yet haggling the details.
In truth, I lack the gold to purchase this place outright.
Oh, spare me that look! I'm not asking a single coin of you.
I've my own designs on how to gain the capital...
Ah, look who it is! Welcome to Madeleine's shop!
Mmm, might be a bit much, as I've not yet purchased the shop in full. Let me try again:
Welcome to what will doubtless soon be known as Madeleine's shop!
You're a different matter though, of course. You gave me aid in my darkest hour, and I love you for it.
Any case, looks as though I'll be buying this shop outright ere long.
I've scrimped and saved like never afore, and now put such money to good use. Aren't you ever so impressed?
Thanks be to hard work and good fortune, I've finally opened my own shop.
Now I need but spread the word: Come for the beautiful lass what runs the place, stay for the wide selection and fine prices!
Such goes double for you, good ser. Get thee to Madeleine's shop!
Ah, Arisen -- well met, well met!
You swore to visit my shop, but I've had my share of promises broken, and so feared...you might...
Yes, well, here you are! Welcome to Madeleine's shop!
But you've come to shop, not hear me prattle on! Let's to business.
I thought it my end when the dragon took me. Truly, I did. 
But just when hope was lost, you risked all to rescue me. I've no doubt it was the fates at work.
When first we met here, in this village, I was desperate, eh?
Oh, I wore a proud face, but I was at my tether's end, and no mistake.
Thanks to the wyrm, near all the goods I planned to sell were lost.
If not for you, I'd mostlike been forced to sell even myself...
Doubtless such a life would've lead me to an early grave.
From the first moment we spoke, I knew I could rely on you.
And with your support, I found the strength to give it all another go 'round.
You've saved us all from the dragon's wrath.
Call it fate, or fortune, or destiny -- we're the two of us here for a reason, you and I. 
Perhaps we're to spend the rest of our days together... Oh, spare me that look! I say that with all my heart. ...Truly!

No... Quickly, Master!
What is it!?
Monsters!?
The cockatrice must be stopped!
Protect the tribute!
To leave the area would mean<cf>abandoning our duty.
We cannot allow the tribute to come<cf>to harm.
We must protect the chests!
Best we keep the battle some<cf>distance from the chests.
Draw any threats away from the<cf>tribute.
We've lost a chest. We must not<cf>allow any more to be destroyed!
Protect the remaining chests!
We must guard the final tribute with<cf>our lives!
The final chest must survive!
The tribute is lost...
All of the duke's tribute... Gone...
We managed to keep losses to a<cf>minimum.
We've done our duty. Most of<cf>the chests are intact.
'Twill take some time afore it's<cf>restored.
'Tis just ahead.
Look there! The city is under attack!
'Tis... 'Tis a cockatrice attacks the<cf>capital!
The way is blocked. We must hurry<cf>inside!
The path is closed off!<cf>To the western gate!
All ready for battle?
We'll leave when you are ready, Master.
Just down this road, Arisen.
This path will take us to the waycastle.
Do not hesitate to consult your<cf>map, Arisen.
Ugh.
Guh!
Hnnngh...
Ha!
Raha!
How d'you fare?

Aye.

Aye, fine.
Not a chance.
These days, a good weapon's a need no different than food or shelter. 
I'll confess, I do this half for the love of it.
Business is rosey and still on the rise.
Perhaps it's that idol I should thank for the fine mood I'm in.
A word about that idol, friend.
One of my suppliers took to laughing when he saw it. Says I've been had.
I can ill see the Arisen pulling tricks...
But I am not one to be mocked. Best you know that.
Me, I've no love of magick and its kind.
Iron and steel, honed to an edge. That's all a man really needs.
If you've cause to cross monsters, it's steel and muscle will see you through.
Especially if it's steel from my shop.
After a weapon fit to slay the wyrm, are you? I don't ken whether such a thing even exists...
But a good weapon is tempered with use. The steel grows stronger with each battle.
Same as the arm that wields it.
No weapon can make you a match for the dragon.
Temper yourself. Once you're fit to best the wyrm, your weapon will rise to the task.
You have my thanks.

This is no mere tremor. No natural force wrought this collapse.
I can but think a force most evil has cursed Gran Soren to ruin...
Did you know of this? Had you some inkling, some sign of... Nay, 'tis beyond all human ken, I know.
I pray only that His Grace is safe.
The dragon's fearsome, no doubt, but we'll be safe here in the castle. Right?
This is Duke Edmun Dragonsbane's castle. The wyrm wouldn't dare approach it. Right?
It's right there in his name, Dragonsbane.
The dragon's awakened?

Valmiro? Saw him up a tree in pursuit of a...bird or the like. But that was some time ago.
Missing? Again? Maker's breath, the lad's head must be stuffed with seaweed...
He did talk of exploring the lands further south, last I saw him.
I wager you'll find him there, by a forest or river mostlike -- someplace with critters to get after.
I only pray he's more than a corpse when you find him.
I am he who flays the skin. Let us see if you can stand for true.
Ignore your surroundings at your<cf>great peril.
No wanderer is ever lost with a map<cf>at their side.
Treat every shadow as though a<cf>monster lurks within.
Wary travelers should stick to the roads...<cf>they are are relatively safe and free of monsters.
There's no shame in fleeing from an<cf>overpowering foe.
Journeys end swiftly for the unprepared.
Watch where you step. Many a useful<cf>item might lie underfoot.  
Gransys is home to a vast array of<cf>different monsters.
Dangerous monsters lurk in the<cf>water. Tread there lightly, if at all.
Burdening yourself with items and<cf>equipment will cost you speed.
Follow the roads and you will never<cf>lose your way.
Certain items can only be found as<cf>loot from vanquished foes.
Being drenched with water can affect<cf>one in a variety of ways...
Not all monsters are dull creatures.<cf>Some will lay traps for you!
Stronger, more ferocious monsters<cf>lurk in Gransys' frontier lands.
Spots to mine and harvest materials<cf>are spread throughout Gransys.
You have more to fear than just<cf>monsters. Be wary, always.
Do not despair at dead ends. A<cf>careful search might reveal the way. 
Ruins and abandoned buildings are<cf>havens for bandits.
Traveling merchants sometimes offer<cf>especially rare goods.
Only a fool wanders the darkness<cf>without a light.
Wander aimlessly at night, and you<cf>won't live to see the morning.
Monsters grow more active when<cf>night falls.
In the darkness, your ears tell you<cf>much that your eyes cannot.
Being without ample lantern oil may<cf>lead to your darkest hour.
Faraway lights are not always of<cf>human origin. Beware.
Bound for a long journey? 'Tis<cf>safest to travel strictly by day. 
Do not rely on your eyes at night.<cf>Attune your ears to the darkness.
If you must travel at night, seek<cf>safety in numbers.
Nightfall brings danger, but also<cf>items that cannot be found by day.
Stick close to your companions<cf>when traveling at night.
The Witchwood is fraught with<cf>powerful monsters.
A dense forest lies ahead.<cf>Be wary...
Lose your path in this wood and you<cf>may very well lose your life.
Who can say what monsters await<cf>in these dark bowers...
Let your focus stray for a moment<cf>and you shall quickly lose your way.
At night, the forest is even more<cf>dangerous. Use extreme caution.
One can either hope to avoid danger,<cf>or prepare to face it.
The forest is a pit of darkness.<cf>Your eyes ill serve you here.
Are you well stocked in curatives?
Danger rarely comes with warning.<cf>Proceed carefully.
Your lantern oil is your life's<cf>blood. Do not let it run dry.
Nights need not be long. You can rest at an inn to<cf>advance time from night to day, and vice versa.
Treat others well, and they shall<cf>treat you well in kind.
People seldom venture out at night.<cf>Seek information in the daytime.
Attacking others or being a nuisance<cf>will gain you nothing but enemies.
You can learn skills and change vocations<cf>at inns and other locations you can rest.
Stock up on consumable items while<cf>you have the chance.
The capabilities of some weapons<cf>and armor can be further enhanced.
Gran Soren is Gransys' capital and<cf>largest city.
The capital is the best place to<cf>purchase items and equipment.
The city is made up of noble and<cf>craftsman quarters, and the slums.
Pawns are forbidden from entering<cf>the castle.
Behave yourself in the duke's<cf>demesne, or visit the dungeon.
Use rifts to search for and employ<cf>pawns quickly and easily.
Duke Edmun, leader of all Gransys,<cf>is often hailed as the "dragon's bane."
You may speak with and hire<cf>wandering pawns on the street.
You never know what you might find<cf>on city streets. Keep your eyes open.
Watch your step. The city has many<cf>high places from which to fall.
The city is well situated as a base<cf>for all your travels.
Stealing into the duke's demesne<cf>by night is no easy feat...
Barnaby manages the Pawn Guild and<cf>serves as keeper of the Everfall.
Missteps in a place like this will lead<cf>to long falls with abrupt ends.
Such dizzying heights... It seems a<cf>pit without end.
A loss of focus and a loss of<cf>balance leads to a loss of life.
Do not be afraid to retreat if you<cf>sense great danger.
Consider revamping your party if<cf>progress seems impossible.
If you feel ill prepared for this<cf>land, do not force the matter.
If you would proceed, best be<cf>prepared for every contingency.
Entering a very dark, very eerie place.
The stench of this place is nearly<cf>overwhelming...
Prepare yourself for grueling battle.
Only those well prepared ought<cf>continue down this path.
Beware of foes setting upon you in<cf>the darkness.
The most powerful of foes yet awaits<cf>deeper inside...
Perhaps especially valuable treasure<cf>might be found here.
The path ahead is strong with the<cf>foul stench of death.
You sense great danger with every<cf>fiber of your being.
The crushing, black sky seems to<cf>portend some dark future, but...what?
Since the dragon's defeat, the monsters<cf>seem more active than ever. Be prepared.
Be wary!<cf>Ferocious monsters lurk nearby.
It is as if everything changed in<cf>that single instant...
The Everfall...<cf>What secrets lurk within its depths?
Might this be part of the trial the<cf>dragon devised for you?
A vast army formed to slay a dragon, the ultimate<cf>incarnation of evil. But against such fearsome<cf>resistance, the army was crushed.<cf><cf>The people's hopes fell upon a chosen one,<cf>and with those who followed this gifted soul...
You feel an odd pride as you plunge the Godsbane into your<cf>chest, as if claiming a great victory. Finally, there is an<cf>end for your tale -- one penned by your own hand, no less.<cf>As your consciousness fades into the black, you feel a<cf>peculiar sensation on your lips: you are smiling.<cf><cf>Cleansed by the surf, a body washes ashore on a deserted<cf>beach. Nameless, this soul awakens, eyes gleaming with the<cf>will to live, and for all things worth living for.
Today, like every day, waves gently lap at the shore<cf>near your tiny village.<cf><cf>The twin blessings of warm sun and bounteous waters afford<cf>a simple but pleasant life. Nets are cast and chores completed;<cf>friends and families gather to laugh and talk around the fire.<cf><cf>So it has always been, and so it will always be...of this,<cf>you are certain.<cf><cf>Until the afternoon grows late, and you hear the rush of wingbeats...
What fate awaits you in this place...?
"I sense a grave and powerful presence.<cf>Be it friend or foe?"
Bitterblack Isle is a place shrouded in<cf>mystery, imperceptible to all but those<cf>touched by the dragon.
Take a moment to ensure your skills and<cf>equipment are readied for the trials ahead.
Strategic retreat can be a critically<cf>important option in any combat situation.
If you've an item obscured by a curse,<cf>bring it to one versed in the art of<cf>purification.
The virtues of Bitterblack items are oft<cf>shrouded by a curse. In that state,<cf>they're of scant use to anyone.
"I've heard tales of monsters so depraved<cf>that they gather to feast at the corpses<cf>of their fallen comrades."
You may think you've purged an area of<cf>monsters, but that doesn't mean it's safe. <cf>Never drop your guard!
The labyrinth holds creatures that no man on<cf>the peninsula has ever beheld afore.
"I feel...some manner of presence here..."
Another request board awaits you here.
Broken riftstones might function<cf>again if they can be repaired.
A blighted soul haunts every inch of<cf>this terrible place...
This stratum feels somehow different from<cf>the one before it. Be ever vigilant.
The deeper you travel, the more aggressive<cf>the corpse-feeding creatures seem to become...
Beware the wrath of your pursuer, death.
Not all treasure chests in the labyrinth<cf>are equally rewarding...
The Bitterblack items found in the deeper<cf>levels of the labyrinth are quite different<cf>from those found above.
"The geography of this place is utterly<cf>incomprehensible... Is it the result of<cf>some being's will?"
Voices linger here and there... The stories<cf>they recount can bestir a beating heart.
"Waves of lament echo from the farthest depths,<cf>reminding me, somehow, of my master's soul..."
"I see omens of a fierce battle brewing..."
"The fate of an Arisen... It seems there<cf>are some paths even we pawns do not know..."
"I feel the gaze of someone...something<cf>from another world, beyond our ken..."
Damnable hexer!
Guards! Do something!
M-monster!
Aaah!
I owe you a debt, ser... My thanks, truly.
They were of the southron bandits, from the look of them. Worse than monsters, their kind...
Thanks to you, I'm alive and whole, but those rats made off with all I had... Even took that magick book...
Mm? Have an interest in such tomes, do you?
This was Salomet's grimoire.
Seems it chanced to survive the blaze when the old council's library burned down.
'Tis a rare and powerful tome, as I hear it told, so I bought it from a merchant of my acquaintance.
If it truly holds such power, the likes of Salvation would-- Er, it matters not.
I-in any case, 'tis lost now to those damnable thieves.
Next our paths cross, I'll take them for all they're worth.
H-help me!
No! Augh!
Stop! Stop!
'Tis locked. You haven't the key to fit it...
'Tis caught on something. Perhaps it could open from the far side.
'Tis barred shut. Might be able to break the bolt.
'Tis shut tight.
'Tis no use at this hour. You'll have to come again later.
Best stop for now.
Seems they're closed.
Someone was here...
Lost them...
Gone...
Perhaps you've upset them.
There's naught to do here.
Best you moved on.
Not here...
The door is closed.
Shows no sign of opening.
There's aught there...
You don't see anything.
That smell...
Someone's near...
What's this...?
Fine view from here.
There's aught written here...
Must be a way to find something...
Smells delicious.
Perfect spot to place something.
You can almost reach...
There appears to be aught ahead.
That fall could kill.
'Tis dangerous to touch.
A strong blow might break it.
Perhaps if you came by night.
Perhaps if you came by day.
Perhaps if you came at dawn.
Perhaps if you came at dusk.
There's aught buried here...
You see no way up.
'Tis slick, this spot.
No use pressing any further.
No need to double back further.
No time for that now.
You cannot carry any more.
There may yet be aught lying about.
Seems there's naught you can take on at present.<cf>Best to try again later.
Perhaps with a bit of help...
Best you kept your weapon sheathed.
Is someone here...?
'Tis a place for tall folk.
'Tis a place for small folk.
Had you a woman in your band...
Had you a man in your band...
Had you a strong companion...
Had you a swift companion...
Had you a magick user...
Had you an apt climber...
Had you a skilled jumper...
This weapon will not help you.
That armor won't protect you.
You're ill equipped for this.
Seems it can't be used now.
You'll get no further use from it.
'Tis useless, now.
Hmm, not with your current equipment...
Not with your current party...
You hear aught from further in.
Enemies... They're close.
Best you got some rest.
You can carry no more!
You're too exhausted!
"Danger! Keep Out!"
"No Trespassing"
A sign.
Had you an Empty Flask, you might fill it here.
You'll get no further without a lantern.
'Tis dangerous to fumble about in the dark. Best find a light.
Best not just leave them.
If aught were left here, it would rot.
Best take care you don't get lost.
Best check the map.
You're due for a rest.
This place is dangerous by night.
This place is dangerous by day.
Breathtaking...
You'll get no further!
Seems you'll need to come back.
Nothing left here.
It looks fit to crumble.
Seems it could be moved...
It will not budge.
It will not open.
Seems you need a key.
Seems you need a Pickaxe here.
You yet lack the experience.
You yet lack the skill.
Not with your current vocation...
You'll not pass through this gate.
You've no time!
Seems you were too late.
You may make it, yet.
You're doing well for time.
Seems you've come at the wrong time.
There may be another path.
The way is blocked by fallen stone.
A saurian egg. You can hear a faint heartbeat from within...
'Tis a powerful weapon... Too bad it doesn't work.
Be wary near any body of water. Wade too<cf>deep and you might be enveloped by the<cf>fog-like monster known as the Brine.
Wander too deep or idle too long in the<cf>water and you'll fall unconscious, washing<cf>ashore later at some faraway place. 
A Ferrystone will spirit you back to Gran<cf>Soren in an instant, no matter where you<cf>are located.
It is by far the fastest and safest method<cf>of travel, but each stone disappears after<cf>a single use.
You can equip yourself with a primary and<cf>a secondary weapon.
Primary weapons such as swords and daggers<cf>are combat essentials. Secondary weapons<cf>like bows and shields offer support.
In addition to weapons and armor, you can<cf>also equip accoutrements with certain special<cf>abilities to give you an edge in battle.
Only one piece of jewelry and a single<cf>cloak can be equipped as accoutrements<cf>at any one time.
A heavy load will cause your Stamina to<cf>deplete more quickly. Sell or discard<cf>any and all items you no longer need.
Your lantern consumes oil. If it dims,<cf>use a Flask of Oil to refill it.
Some items can be combined with others to<cf>produce surprising results. Experiment and<cf>see what you come up with. 
Place waypoint markers on your map to<cf>keep track of your progress.
If you've forgotten where you are in the story,<cf>select "Chronicle" from the Pause Menu to<cf>review a history of your journey thus far.
Select "Options" from the Pause Menu to<cf>customize your mini-map and status display.
The higher the fall, the more damage you<cf>will suffer.
Note that you move somewhat slower while<cf>your weapon is drawn.
Exhausting all Stamina will make you unable<cf>to act for a time. Take care to conserve<cf>energy!
You can attack while clinging to foes.
Petrifaction cannot be cured by normal<cf>magick, and is fatal if left untreated.
Use Secret Softener or the like to<cf>cure any petrified allies.
Your rank within a vocation rises as you<cf>defeat foes and complete quests. At higher<cf>ranks, a broader variety of skills are available.
Defeating foes and completing quests earns<cf>you more discipline, boosting your prowess<cf>in a vocation.
Pawns will collect and use items of their<cf>own volition.
You cannot carry or purchase items that<cf>would cause you to exceed your maximum<cf>encumbrance.
Press <TUTO><SIZE 25><ICON TOUCH></SIZE> while climbing down a ladder<cf>to descend quickly. 
If a pawn remains unconscious for too long,<cf>they will be forfeit.
Your support pawn has become forfeit, and<cf>returned to the realm whence they came.
Your main pawn has become forfeit,<cf>disappearing and returning to the rift.
You cannot join covenants with other pawns<cf>while your main pawn is forfeit.
Touch any riftstone to return your lost<cf>main pawn to your side.
If a support pawn is forfeit, any items<cf>they were carrying are sent to item storage.
You can send off departing pawns with a<cf>single item as a gift for their creator.
You can pass items to and from your pawns<cf>on the sub menu.
The spirit of man, the soul what animates<cf>him, is that which dwells within the fleshen<cf>vessel for the breathspan of his mortal life.
Tis our curse that the soul must exist in<cf>such incompletion while we remain in this<cf>material coil.
And it is in that incompletion of the soul<cf>that all human suffering, pain, and<cf>lamentation finds its inexorable source.
Whence, then, is salvation?
Tis not to be found in pleasure.
For pleasure is but another manifestation of<cf>the soul's inchoateness. A distraction born<cf>of the flesh.
It is but pain's shadow, and no less a<cf>transient illusion.
For the soul cannot find true pleasure in<cf>this world.
This world which writhes and struggles<cf>against its failings, bludgeoned by its own<cf>heedless throes...
In a true and proper world, all souls would<cf>forever remain in an even state, perfect and<cf>complete as they are unchanging.
Where can we look to find such balance?<cf>Wherein lies the equilibrium our tortured<cf>world seeks? In the dragon! Bestower of fear<cf>to all man in equal measure.
The dragon is the force by which the world<cf>will right itself, and we are duty bound to<cf>cede our souls unto it.
If we seek freedom from pain unending and<cf>comfort in the constancy of the soul made<cf>complete, we must submit to its fiery<cf>arbitration.
Think not of this as surrender, nor as the<cf>escape of the weak or the craven.
No! I bid you, do not run from fear. Do not<cf>hate it.
For it is fear which rarefies and distills<cf>the soul unto its rightful, lofty character.
It's hopeless...
We've no chance. Run!
H-help...
Waaaugh!
Uh!
Guh!
Eeaaagh...
Hoh!
Taah!
Faring well, friend?
Pray, be not a stranger.
Right you are.
You're wrong there.
My thanks.
Ho, that's just fine! I thank you.
My, my! Every bit the Arisen, you are.
A far cry from the petty frauds the city's seen of late, all scraping for a bit of coin.
No, you have the look of someone who can be trusted to see a task through.
Still, some shock, aye? With the dragon about, everyone is bracing for the long fight to come.
Were I a bit younger in my years, I'd be out to make a trophy of a fang or two myself.
But with you now arrived, it wouldn't do to go stealing your glory, would it?
I feel there's aught I've forgotten... Getting old is a terrible thing.
Mason? Aye, I know the man...
He's at sixes and sevens with that Salvation lot you hear talk of these days, though he's not quick to share the details.
There's precious little I can say on it for certain.
He brings rumors from the neighboring lands, and I repay him in old war stories. That's all.
Hoy, friend. Idle, are you? Here for a tale from my younger days, perhaps?
Truth be told, I was a sellsword in my youth. Stood watch while strongholds and castle walls were built.
Lent my greatsword to the great goblin purge of twenty years back, I did.
So, what say you, friend? Eager to have me join you on your Wyrm Hunt?
D'you know of that tunnel, deep in the quarry south of here?
It's more a monster's nest than aught else by now, but there was a time it housed a treasure worthy of legends.
Least, I seem to recall hearing aught to that effect at some point...
The sad ruins of a dead castle stand to the west of the southern tip of Gransys.
The work of the last dragon, that. Struck fifty years ago, and the land lies barren still.
Even the mightiest hold's but a castle in the sand before the dragon, I fear.
Have you seen the tower stands northwest of the shore, friend? Out upon the cape.
The Bluemoon Tower, they call it, built by a duke of Gransys generations past to stand as a testament of his power.
Now it stands mostly as a home to monsters. The road leading to its base is no better, talk is.
That was some commotion at the western gate.
More of your handiwork, was it? Impressive as ever, friend.
By now you're the town hero, you. There's no end to your feats.
Should it all wind you in the duke's seat, I pray you'll not forget your friends among the common folk.
Seems we're still in one piece, you and I.
Still, this is quite the happening... 'Tis more than even I'd imagined.
My thanks.
So, what of your audience with His Grace?
Even in age, he cuts an imposing figure worthy of the title Dragonsbane.
In truth, he is of an age with my own grandfather, if that can be believed.
The duke is hale and hearty as a man half his years!
A shame he has weathered all this time only to be faced with the dragon once again.
The Wyrm Hunt runs deep in His Grace's blood, no doubt. May he live to see a third!
This recent string of troubles has taken its toll on His Grace the duke.
Scant few men remain to guard the castle, myself among them.
The rest, he's sent to every stronghold in the land to prepare for the dragon's coming.
Morale is low, despite our efforts. The men are capable, but in this state...
It causes me worry.
Your efforts have been no small help, ser.
You have my thanks.
Soon we ride upon the wyrm...
I harbor no illusions that I am any match for the beast.
But I'll count it an honor to stand beside His Grace and bare my steel for the people of Gransys.
'Tis locked. You haven't the key to fit it...
'Tis caught on something. Perhaps it could open from the far side.
'Tis barred shut. Might be able to break the bolt.
'Tis shut tight.
'Tis no use at this hour. You'll have to come again later.

You may make it, yet.
You're doing well for time.
Seems you've come at the wrong time.
There may be another path.
'Tis a powerful weapon... Too bad it doesn't work.
Something strong can be sensed from the stone. It <cf>appears the memories of someone have been etched<cf>upon the surface of the Monument of Remembrance.
A broken riftstone. Looks like you might be<cf>able to restore it by using rift crystals.
Restore the riftstone?<cf>Current rift crystals: <RIMS><cf>Rift crystal cost: <RIM2>
You haven't enough rift crystals to restore it.
The slopes of the Tainted Mountain are deadly steep and fraught with dangers, ser.
If you must go, pray, go prepared for the worst.
Ambush!
Enemies set upon you without warning!<cf>Fend off and slay the brutes.








Slay Your Enemies

Escape from Enemy Territory



A look around the village may prove helpful.
Brilliant work!
Just as planned!
Might this thief be the Iron Hammer's<cf>traitor?
The Iron Hammer... 'Tis the sign of the<cf>bandits what hold that southern castle. 
Best we spoke to the victims.
Let's speak with the grocer and the<cf>apothecary.
Best speak with Heraldo at the grocery.
Aestella, the apothecary, will have<cf>aught to say.
If we can lift the thief off his feet, he's ours.
Preparations are complete, Master.<cf>Pablos awaits you.
Where shall we begin? Perhaps a survey of<cf>the village.
We pawns shall wait outside the<cf>village once you're ready to begin.
This oughtn't take long.
Knowing when to employ muscle and<cf>when magick is key...
You'd do well to slay the lot of them<cf>at once.
Arrows and spells can reach distant<cf>targets.
Anything you've overlooked, Master?
Calm consideration ever wins the day,<cf>Master.
You'll no doubt have cause to call my<cf>kind through the rift in times future.
Note each pawn's traits and strengths,<cf>and tailor your party accordingly.
You can exchange pawns anywhere you<cf>find one of these "riftstones".
Slay them all!
Let us slay the lot of them!
We've time aplenty.
Ho, there she is! 
Ho, there she is!

Hah!
Ragh!
Yah!
It ends!
Die!
'Tis mine!
I have it!
Now...
'Tis over!
This ends it!
Come!
...'Tis not working!
'Tis useless!
What?
My attack did nothing...!
That was effective!
That blow struck true!
That sent it reeling!
It hates fire!
'Tis weak to fire!
Fire works well!
It hates ice!
'Tis weak to ice!
Ice works well!
It hates lightning!
'Tis weak to lightning!
Lightning works well!
It hates darkness!
'Tis weak to darkness!
Darkness works well!
It hates light!
'Tis weak to light!
Light works well!
Now! Attack!
It is hurt!
An opening!
Give no quarter!
Show no mercy!
Strike with all you have!
Hit it with all your might!
Take the offensive!
The boon of flame!
With flame's caress...
With ice's bite...
The boon of lightning...!
With lightning's crack...
The boon of darkness...!
The boon of light...!
With holy light...
With magick's boon...
Here!
Strike the head!
I'll aim for the head!
Lightning, lend thy sting!
Fire, lend thy kiss!
Ice, lend thy bite!
All-consuming flames...
Split the sky!
Shine, radiant bolt...
Take my fire!
I grant you fire's blaze!
I grant you ice's bite!
We must seal that magick!
To attack from here...!
Take care to stay clear!
Magick does nothing!
'Tis nigh-immune to magick!
Watch for its spells!
O, lightning!
Take my lightning!
It...swallowed...
I grant you lightning's fangs!
Is that hiss...gas?
It looks ready to spit something!
Beware the blast!
Take my darkness!
Strike with shade!
I grant you shadow's cloak!
Take the power of flame!
I grant your weapons fire!
Strike with flame's blast!
Take the power of ice!
I lend you frost's power!
Strike with ice's chill!
The blessing of thunder!
Take the power of lightning!
Strike with lightning's spark!
I grant you sacred radiance!
Holy light, bless this weapon!
Strike with light's purity!
I grant your weapons darkness!
Take the power of darkness!
Strike with shadow's abyss!
I shall blind it!
I'll rob it of sight!
Be lost in shadow!
I shall poison it!
Come, ruinous venom!
I'll seal its magick!
Fall silent!
You shall not cast!
Fall still!
Time, slow your march!
Be healed!
I'll treat your wounds!
I'll mirror your spell!
Leave it to us!
I cannot take much more...
My consciousness...fades...
Please help me!
I cannot see!
I am poisoned!
Poison!
I cannot move!
I am bound!
I cannot use magick!
My spells are sealed!
I have an ailment!
We'll soon be overwhelmed...
Keep your distance!
'Tis dangerous! Stay back!
I'll draw its attention.
I'll provoke it!
I'll give you flight!
I'll send you flying!
Use me to leap!
Let me grant you wings!
Stay with me!
No... No!
Open your eyes!
Up and at them, Arisen.
I'll catch you!
Now, set that oil afire!
Very well!
Yes!
On my way!
Leave it to me!
Coming!
Yes, Master.
I'll aid you at once!
I'm coming to help!
I cannot obey right now!
Ice serves well against them!
Did it!
Well done!
What a gaffe...
I was clumsy...
Gah! H-help me!
Don't let them surround us!
Their backs are unprotected!
Aim for their backs!
I'll strike from their rear!
Now, Arisen! End it!
Here, master! Quickly, attack!
A spell of darkness will blind them!
I'll put an end to it!
I shall still the beast!
I'll attack from a safe distance!
I'll fire arrows from afar!
That oil... They're primed to burn!
Blows to the head work well!
Give it a taste of ice!
I'll draw it near.
 I'll act as bait.
This corpse might draw it near...
The beast fears fire.
I'll grab hold of it!
I'll grab it -- take the chance to attack!
Attack while I hold it!
I'll lift you up to grab hold!
Now! Focus your attack!
Take this, foul beast! 
I'll stop it dead!
Quickly! Let fly a fearsome blow!
Gah! H-help me!
Beware its sleep spells!
I'll still it as best I can!
This ends now!
I'll fell it in a single blow!
Strike with fire!
Burn them to ash!
Strike with ice!
Freeze them where they stand!
Strike with lightning!
Transfix them with lightning!
Strike with darkness!
I attack with darkness black!
Strike with holy power!
Purge them with holy light!
'Tis not worth the time.
Let's put an end to them<cf>for good and all!
Not long now!
Now! Finish it!
'Tis bathed in oil! Bring fire!
Rain steel upon it!
Burn them!
Quickly!
I'll hold it! Attack, quickly!
I've hold of one! Now, strike!
Let's see how it likes flame!
I shall ground it!
I'll fill it with arrows!
I'll bring you down...
I'll follow with flame!
Coming, Arisen! I'll finish it!
I have it -- hurry!
This corpse might draw it near...
Monsters, Arisen! Ready yourself.
Some small foe lurks ahead, Arisen...
It's massive...
A flying beast, Arisen!
If we could but silence it...!
Go! Strike with my lightning!
Its head is vulnerable!
Now! I'll aim for the head!
Bait could lure it near.
I'll grab it!
Now! Attack the head!
This corpse would serve as bait.
Now, strike its head!
I'll launch you skyward!
I'll combine my magick with<cf>yours.
'Tis our chance!
It's fallen! Strike!
It's every blow is fearsome strong!
Those spells are a nuisance...
Best we began with the spellcasters!
Their bite bears a wicked venom!
Victory is ours!
Waugh! H-help me!
It's down! I'll give it my steel.
It's fallen! I'll put it to fire.
This way, hurry!
Quick, before they regroup!
Aye, show no mercy!
I must away!
I'll join you!
Now! My fire is yours!
Hold it, I'll end this!
Keep hold of it!
Hold it -- I'll do the rest!
I'll finish this!
I shall strike the head!
I'll stop it!
Shake loose, master!
It flees...
It flees! Chase it!
It flees! Run it down!
Slay them one by one!
Slay the leader first!
Ready the mithridate! Their bite brings<cf>poison!
Take them one at a time!
Mind they do not rob you of your sight!
I'll not end a meal for these curs...
'Tis massive, and seems strong to match.
Its strength far exceeds its humbler<cf>cousins'!
Gauge its range well!
Avoid standing before it!
Giant or no, 'tis a saurian still!<cf>Strike the tail!
Magick fares well against spectral foes!
Beware the fiend's curses!
Aim for the head!
Scale its frame and strike the head!
I can scarce stomach getting closer...
Do not allow it to knock you down!
'Tis a fearsome foe!
Take aim for its head!
Foes lacking corporal form will fall to<cf>magick!
Steel finds no purchase against spectral<cf>foes!
Wake those put to sleep with all haste!
Even a moment's distraction can kill!
A foe I'd hoped to avoid...
Look out! Its breath will putrefy our<cf>belongings!
'Tis set to burn, for good and all!
Burn them to ash!
Their blindness confuses them.
I blight you with Blindness!
Strike from a distance!
I'll strike him from afar!
I'll aid you with bowfire!
It is enraged! Look out!
Let us watch and wait.
It's over!
I send you back to the grave!
'Tis our chance!
Now! Bring fire!
I'll hold it still!
I'll stay it with ice!
I'll have it in ashes while the oil<cf>still holds!
I'll hold the creature still!
Do not let go!
I'll burn them where they stand!
Strike at it with magick!
A fine result!
'Twas a near miss, that.
Die, villain!
Now!
Have at you!
Stun it with lightning!
This should be a simple battle!
'Tis no threat to us!
We've the advantage! Keep attacking!
Strike with holy light!
May this light be your end!
I'll imbue your weapon with holy light!
Rragh!
Mm... I've gained some new insight.
Mm, I'll put this knowledge to use<cf>next time...
I've learned plenty from this battle...
Mm, this battle's taught me much...
I've learned a new way to fight<cf>their ilk.
All I've learned from you will make<cf>the next battle far easier.
Ah... I've new insight into our quest.
Mm... I recall aught of our current<cf>task.
Ah, I've a better grasp on the lay<cf>of the land, now...
Mmm... I've a better feel for the<cf>area now.
Hmm, yes... I understand this area<cf>better.
Aim for the wings!
Aim for its tusks!
Aim for the throat!
Aim for its weapon arm!
Strike where it's unarmored!
Blunt strikes serve well!
Blindness serves well!
Smite the lot of them with lightning!
Beware their lightning!
Take care you aren't poisoned!
Mind you aren't stricken with torpor!
Mind you aren't put to sleep!
Mind you aren't doused in oil!
Take care you aren't soaked in water!
Mind you aren't cursed!
Take care you aren't petrified!
Mind those claws!
Mind those fangs!
Mind that tail!
Mind that breath!
Mind those wingbeats!
Slay their leader and their morale<cf>is lost!
Rrgh, they grow frenzied!
Rrgh, if we cannot fell their<cf>leader soon...
Its armor is rent!
Its helmet is off!
Stop! N-no!
Let...go! Fiend!
None may touch the Arisen!
Struggle as best you can!
Rrgh! Now, quickly!
Let's circle round the back!
It parries any frontal attacks!
Two of us might hold it down!
Let's all of us grab hold of it!
I'll grab its head!
I'll grab its back!
I'll grab it where it's weakest!
I'll scale it and strike from above!
I'll scale it. Strike while it's distracted!
We'll rout them in a single charge!
Let's press on...
They are few.<cf>Let's charge through them.
Their numbers are few.
We match their numbers...
They are many, Arisen!
If any more of them arrive...
Th-they're too many!
We must strike them down in groups!
There's no end to them!
'Tis a massive pack!
We can stand against their numbers!
Even in numbers, a weakling is a<cf>weakling still!
A moment's distraction can prove<cf>fatal!
We must outlast them!
No! They hold the advantage!
Perhaps we'd best flee for now!
Is this the end!?
Your orders, Arisen? At this rate...
Rally! We must reform the line!
Nary a scratch on it...!
Rrgh, are we even hurting it!?
Sturdy blighter, isn't it...
I daresay we're hurting it!
Our blows are finding purchase!
That attack struck deep!
It must be well hurt by now!
Not long now!
'Tis near dead!
'Tis useless, we can't hurt it!
It's barely flinched!
It's begun to anger! Beware!
I cannot get near it in this state!
Its barrier is fallen!
'Tis less a threat now!
'Tis disarmed for now!
We must pull it down, first!
Fall, beast!
Its wings -- afore it flies again!
Strip its wings and it cannot fly!
On solid ground the advantage is ours!
'Tis slow to come down...
Had we the means to shoot it down...
Do not allow it to grab hold of you!
Is... Is that a monster!?
Augh?! Our meat and vegetables rot!
Such devastating power!
It stands firm... Does it feel no pain?!
New foes?! Is it the others' corpses drew<cf>them here?
Seems the stench of death has lured<cf>further beasts...
Necrophagous beasts are come! Stand ready!
Beware! New foes are come to feast upon<cf>the dead!
They come in packs to scavenge!
Rotten meat would serve as bait to lure<cf>out scavengers.
There are ways to draw out necrophagous<cf>foes.
Scavengers are drawn to cadavers...<cf>A trait we can exploit to hunt them.
The beasts are unguarded as they scavenge<cf>the dead.
They are distracted by the carrion!
Put steel to them afore they finish their<cf>grim banquet!
Now! Strike them from behind!
Don't allow it to grab you!
'Tis enormous!
I did not think a beast of such<cf>scale existed...
Large or small, any monster can be<cf>slain!
So, what do you propose?
Waugh! It's grown another!
More and more keep growing back!
Curative magick? That complicates<cf>matters...
Slay the healer first!
Brace for their magick!
Such advanced magick!?
Its breath is fearsome powerful!
Even a glancing blow is deadly...!
'Tis too powerful!
It has power to match its size!
Hammers... I loathe hammers.
Watch for ranged attacks!
I'll blind them!
Attack once I've blinded them!
Now, while it's blind!
I'll follow with ice!
I'll strike at its back!
I'll take aim from afar!
Let's have its armor and shield off!
We cannot hope to overpower them!
We cannot allow that call! Stop it,<cf>now!
That weapon is a threat. Be wary!
We must stop that weapon!
I'll still that weapon!
Out of the way!
Falling back!
No! Run!
Water is useless!
Water does nothing!
Let's wait and see what they do!
Watch their behavior, then take<cf>careful aim!
I'll keep watch!
It will only counter your blows!
Rrgh, let go!
Back, cursed beast!
A shield will halt their lunges!
Deflect with your shield, then attack!
Block their lunges with a shield!
They're open after a blocked lunge!
That should slow their movement!
They're simple prey once hobbled!
This spell will slow them!
Let's slow them, then finish the task!
They're no threat to us silent!
I'll seal their howls!
You'll not howl after this!
We've good as won once they're<cf>silenced!
Hold it still while I finish it!
Hold it fast! I'll slow its movement!
Leave slowing them to me, Arisen!
Get off! Get off!
Help me!
Augh! Help!
I'll circle round back and strike<cf>the tail!
'Tis best to sever the tail!
We need but sever the tail!
I've a hold on it! Quickly!
I'll hold it! Continue the attack!
I'll hold it! Finish it, quickly!
'Tis fallen! Now!
Finish it while it's down!
Slay it where it lays!
Rrgh! I'm on my way!
Be still! I'll have them off!
I'm coming, Arisen!
We must be cautious!
Best we watch and wait!
'Tis swift! Be careful, Arisen!
Quickly, while it reels!
'Tis exposed after it attacks!
I'll hamper it as best I can!
Dark attacks serve well!
I'll strike it with darkness!
Magick serves well!
I'll attack the first opening I see!
I'll strike the moment it's open!
I'll try oil!
I'll bathe it in oil. Ready a flame!
I'll douse it in oil! Follow with fire!
I cannot breach its armor!
I'll soak it through. Ready ice!
I'll douse it with water!
I'll douse it with water! Follow<cf>with ice!
Let's thin their numbers!
Watch its attacks!
Do not let it put you to sleep!
There.
That's the one.
Found you.
Prepare yourself.
End them.
Kill them, no matter the cost.
Leave no survivors.

That hexer's lived there for many a year. Even as a child I heard cradle tales of her witchery.
Listen. The sound of battle carries from afar...
I know not who, nor where, but someplace the fight rages on...
I must say, Arisen, you've an uncommon intellect, and a shrewd nature to match.
'Tis some manner of fate what caused our paths to intersect.
Pray, take this. A humble token of our fellowship.
The Great Hereafter
You have become the new Seneschal, keeper of the<cf>world. This home shall be yours for eternity.

We don't like your kind.
Pitiful.
Did you somehow get the impression you were wanted here?
Brazen fool! Away with you!
Your title means little here, Arisen.
Such a frightened little mouse!
Run along! The big girls are busy.
It seems we're suffering from a rat infestation.
You've got some spirit after all.
Take it easy, friend.
The capital...is fallen...
What has happened...?<cf>We must find answers!
The duke is like to be in his solar...
Go, Arisen. Hurry!
Quickly, to the castle!
I can follow no further.
Are you all right!?
Come... We must away!
What's happened!?
They have us in numbers!<cf>We must away!
We'll never defeat them...<cf>We can naught  but flee!
Let us flee the city and put them off our trail!
Steady on, Arisen! Go!
This way! Hurry!
We must flee!
An endless night has taken the land...<cf>What evil is this?
It seems 'tis more than gloom<cf>we face. The capital is seething...
Arisen... Gran Soren is...<cf>The capital is fallen...
The wyrm put Gran Soren to ruin,<cf>even in death... I fear for the duke.
A man of the castle, Arisen.<cf>Let's ask of what's happened!
I've an ill feeling, Arisen...<cf>Let's make haste for the capital.
Take a moment to review the tasks<cf>you've sworn to see complete.
'Twas a victory hard won...
Let us return to the capital.
Let us begin with that alleyway.
We best make for that alley.
We must head to their gathering place.
Salvation meets in the dead of night.
This must be where Salvation meets.
We near our destination. Tread quietly...
It seems queer to hold a secret meeting<cf>in daylight.
If these meetings are secret, they most<cf>like take place at night.
We cannot be far from the meeting site.<cf>Quietly, now...
Someone comes...
Our map bears the location of Salvation's<cf>meeting place.
We ought confront or follow one of<cf>them...
Let us approach one of them, or tail<cf>them awhile.
Let us shadow them.
We'll take the key once he's hidden it.
Come, take the key he's hidden!
He's hidden the key.
This wins us entry into the catacombs'<cf>depths.
We can use the key from the Salvation<cf>member.
I hear voices beyond the door.
I hear a man's voice...
The door will open when five gems are<cf>placed within it.
It seems the door opens by some trick.
It lies within a coffin here!
Search within the coffins!
The key is hidden in a coffin!
We must find the one controlling the<cf>skeletons!
Find the one who controls the walking<cf>bones!
No matter how many we fell, more will<cf>come.
Ser Maximilian awaits our report.
Let us tell Ser Maximilian of what<cf>happened.
This road will see us to the catacombs.
This way, Arisen.
The catacombs are just ahead. Be vigilant.
Whate'er it was, one of them took summat from the<cf>other. He's the more obvious mark.
I sense... 'Tis a queer presence lies beyond this door.
I hear people beyond, Arisen. This will take us to the<cf>meeting place, no doubt.
Both men are well suspicious... Which do we pursue?
We cannot be far from the meeting site.<cf>Quietly, now...
That tablet! ...Then it has presented itself to you as well, Arisen of the present day.
I held it once myself, though it knew a different form, then. 'Tis the Arisen's bond, an oath given form.
It has shown itself to each Arisen in turn since time immemorial, ever changing its guise. Perhaps it is a test of sorts...
Though it appears a humble tablet now, it will take on the form best suited to you when the time is come.
Mm? That tablet...
I know not its purpose, but I can say beyond doubt that it holds no meaning for you or me.
The Arisen's bond will take its true form in proper time, and not before. Be patient, child.
Then the Arisen's bond has chosen its form. For you, it is become a ring. Take it.
Tis the symbol of an oath that will bind you to what you hold most dear.
That it chose a ring for its shape stands proof that other people are what you hold most dear.
Make no mistake, the one you vouchsafe this ring to will be bound to you most powerfully.
Whether that bond will be your shield or your undoing depends upon you.
Therein lies the nature of the test.
Run!
Protect the young ones!
Such evil...
Aye, the cat has claws... And more grit than the fools in the duke's Guard, I'll grant.
But alas, I've not the time for games, ser. Farewell.
Ugh.
Guh!
Gaaah...
Hnh!
Shaah!
Hoy.
Fare well.
Aye!
Naw.
Ah, my thanks.
Oh, that's fine! Thanks, friend.
...Hmph.
Piss off.
I don't know you.
I don't take kindly to folk I don't know running about my city all puffed up, neither.
I suffer pawns less kindly still. Take that gloomy lot and sod off.
...An Arisen, were you?
I hear tell you met with the Duke himself.
That explains the pawns, at least.
The Duke's granted you his favor? Makes sense enough, given he was an Arisen himself...
Well... At least attempt to live up to his legacy.
I heard tell of your latest feats, friend.
Or should I get used to calling you Your Grace now? You've all my support.
I wish you luck in your Hunt, friend.
I trusted you'd deliver us from the beast from first I saw you, I did!
Oh, that's fine! Thanks, friend.
Ugh.
Guh!
Waaaugh...
Hah!
Yaah!
Well, I hope, ser?
I must be off.
Yes.
I'm afraid not, ser...
Thank you, ser.
Oh, my sincerest thanks!
All men know the dragon to be a dread bane upon this world.
The Faith holds the beast as an evil without peer for its wanton destruction of the Maker's creations.
And so, the devout have long made it a subject of study.
Much of our knowledge sits sealed within the archives of the Grand Cathedral.
Even were I to travel to the mainland, a novitiate such as I would not be allowed entry.
Sorry to have troubled you... There's no need, now.
You performed admirably, ser.
I am sure poor Brother Jean, returned to the Maker's side, thanks you as well.
Still, the dragon remains ever a threat...
'Tis deeply vexing that even the Faith cannot truly predict when it will next appear.
What ought mankind do to combat the dragon?
It falls upon the Faith to guide all its children in resistance, and not merely the Arisen.
Through diligent research, the Faith has become able to predict the beast's coming.
Sadly, though, that foreknowledge is yet incomplete.
Records show, for example, that the dragon came to this land some one hundred fifty years ago.
It was then that the western lands were put to ruin.
Then, again, fifty years before today the dragon came, and was slain by Duke Edmun.
As far back as the Faith's records tell, this is the third time Gransys has seen the beast.
The annals tell of such cases, where the beast besets the same land, time and again.
Yet there are seasons and lands rarely struck. It is a mystery that foils true prognostication.
There is a saying among the Faith's historians that the dragon roars thrice.
While this is the third time this land has seen the beast, the words hold another meaning...
The dragon first appears, then hides itself away for a time, gathering strength.
Then it comes once more to herald the nearing doom. When it appears a final time, it brings fire and perdition.
No man can say why the beast behaves so, or if some design guides its forbearance.
I suppose it is a mercy it affords us any respite at all.
It occurs to me you've faced the dragon once before.
On that day... The day it first descended upon this land.
The next you cross it, the beast may announce the coming holocaust.
Let us pray you slay the wyrm then...
If the dragon lives to come a third time, our fate is sealed.
Naught may stop the fires of destruction once they are loosed upon the land.
The dragon has shown itself again...
It is a sign the beast has grown strong enough to put this land to ruin!
I am but a man, ignorant of the Maker's plans, Arisen. I cannot guide you now...
No, perhaps there was no path to deliverance from the start!
Perdition is upon us! Certain doom is nigh!
The very earth beneath us falls away to nothing...
In truth, the apocalypse the Elysion foretold is upon us.
...Does my involvement with Salvation surprise you so?
What does it matter, now? What does any of it matter?
This land is fated to fall into darkness and ruin.
It is the end of days for this false and fallow world...
And the dawn of a new world beyond it. The true world...
Thank you, ser.

Excellent. So... Have you heard tell of the master weaponsmith in these parts?
His talent is without measure, but he's stubborn as a plowbeast, and sells only to a chosen circle of clients.
To such patrons he gifts an idol, to make his favor known.
I must gain such an icon and access to his wares, no matter what the cost.
It's oft been said you possess a talent for discovery.
Secure me a figurine, and I shall provide weapons the likes of which you never dreamed...
What say you? Will you help?
An Arisen who cares not for stronger weapons? ...The very thought confounds me.
Changed your mind? You stand to gain much by aiding me.
Hear him out
Not now
The idols are said to come in various forms.
Which you secure is not important, so long as it permits me to parlay with the weaponsmith.
I trust your skill is on measure with the task, or I would not ask it of you.
An idol? By the Maker, give it here!
Beautiful... The quality of craft is plain to see. 
Yes, this will do nicely...
Mmm... Quite simple, isn't it? But no matter...
I shall make for the weaponsmith with all speed.
Your efforts will not go unrewarded, Arisen. When next we speak, you should find my selection quite more to your liking!
Mmm... I expected greater craft, in truth. But no matter...
I shall make for the weaponsmith with all speed.
Your efforts will not go unappreciated, Arisen. When next we speak, you shall find my selection quite more to your liking!

I can offer you rest, or see unwanted goods back to the inn in Gran Soren safely.
'Tis my pleasure to serve, ser.
Aye, 'tis dangerous work, but gladly done for the sake of Gransys and yourself, Arisen.
What do you make of that sky, Arisen...? Naught that I can do but carry on, regardless.

The terror... The terror...
Best we speak with Ser Mercedes.
I fear we must accept that Lord<cf>Julien had a role in this...
Hadn't we best speak with<cf>Ser Mercedes, Arisen?
What's befallen the Stone, I wonder?<cf>And Ser Mercedes...
Let us make for the Stone of the<cf>North.
Unrest in the north... Just what has<cf>happened at the Stone?
To the north, Arisen. We must hurry<cf>after Ser Mercedes.
We know the way to the Stone. Let us<cf>make haste.
Ser Mercedes may know what's<cf>transpired here. Let us find her.
Ser Mercedes will be atop the hold by<cf>now.
We had to intervene. She'd have died<cf>for certain.
She made her wishes clear... We were<cf>honor-bound to accede.
We did all that we could.
'Twas a case of irreconcilable visions<cf>of justice...
Sad, yet...there was no other way.
All we can do now is relate these<cf>events to Chamberlain Aldous.
Surely we'll see her again, someday.<cf>Surely...
Lord Julien said he intended to give<cf>himself over to the duke...
Shall we try the dungeon?
Gransys' fate weighed upon him.<cf>He cared, in his own way...
Seems the uprising to the north has<cf>been quelled.
It has been some time since we last<cf>saw Lord Julien, has it not?
This way to the Stone, Master.
We're nearly there.
We'll work to suppress them here!
Leave this place to us, Arisen! Find<cf>Ser Mercedes!
The Stone is also known as Windbluff <cf>Tower. It lies not far from here.
The Stone is this way, Master.
Not that way.
Mrgh!
Nnnrgh...
Aaargh...
Hnh!

How's the day find you?
Maker speed your steps.
Right.
Nah...
Ah, thanks.
Mm yes, my thanks, my thanks.
You seem tired, cousin. Come, rest a moment.
This should do...
As you will.
Here you are.
Very well.
Can't do that, sorry.
Mmm?
Maker's greetings upon you. 
Aye, plenty of village folk fled the dragon's wrath. And with peddlers and travelers in short supply, my inn is near empty.
That bedamned dragon is going to ruin me!
That bedamned dragon is going to ruin me!
Business is better of late. I daresay we've you to thank for that.
Course, you'd never mistake our sleepy village for a bustling marketplace, even in the best of times.
But even a return to our modest custom is welcome indeed.
Business is better of late. I daresay we've you to thank for that.
Strange to imagine anyone crossin' the law in a tiny village such as this.
Life in peaceful confines should be enough to drive the ill from any man.
Clean air leads to clear hearts, or so it's been said. 'Tis a source of great pride 'round these parts...or was, in any case.
What, that matter? I've long handled it myself.
I hear tell you intend a great journey.
Many here would snatch up their family and flee, so great is the fear of the dragon.
And yet, you set out to willingly take on dangers most dire. It's good to meet one not enslaved by fear.
I would have you tell me of inns you see in your travels. They may have comforts I have not yet considered.
Many a traveller from other lands pass though these doors.
Any rumor crosses my ear that might prove helpful, you shall be first to know.
Business is better of late. I daresay we've you to thank for that.
A traveler told me the most curious tale...
He spoke of a hole beneath the capital what leads beyond the rift.
I wonder if that's where pawns come from, eh? Perhaps they spew from the ground like snakes?
Now there's a thought to keep a man up nights.
You heard tell of this group, calls itself Salvation? Buncha madmen, what it is.
Seems they prefer the areas around Gran Soren, and so much the better. I'll not shelter blasphemers under my roof, no matter the color of their coin.
I hear them crazies even plan to help the dragon...
Gather 'round the beast once its come, an' aid it, laying waste to all they see...
Some folks, I tell you... Lot of loonies out there.
Way I heard it, the guards in Gran Soren spend more time sleeping in their cups than protecting the realm.
Doubtless the guard can keep order in a brothel, or shake down an innkeeper for his last few coins...
But if that dragon comes, I'd sooner turn to sisters of the Faith for protection.
Those fools all hold the same silly notion, like as not...
That Duke Dragonsbane will step in, when the time comes, and take care of that dragon, all by his lonesome. Hah!
They say the Faith sends believers to the Grand Cathedral on the mainland, even as we speak. 
The Church gathers accounts from any who saw the dragon, way I heard it.
All well and good to study the wyrm, indeed...
But I fear time for letters and books is a luxury we don't have.
The dragon's fled the mountain, or so the rumors say.
Even should I abandon my trade to the dragon, I'd not last long in the outside world. Keeping an inn is all I've ever known.
You will continue in your trials as well, I imagine? Be careful on your travels, cousin.
The whole of the village raised a cheer upon word of your deeds. I've not seen such joy in many long years.
Thank the Maker I don't have to flee. I would dearly loath to leave this inn behind.
Truly, I cannot thank you enough. Very well done indeed!
Good news cannot last in this world, it seems.
Do they truly mean to blame you for the chasm fresh opened in the capital?
Madness!
It's evil work, that maw. Not even one as powerful as yourself is capable of such. 
There are some who bear you ill will, Arisen -- those who cannot stand watch while glory falls upon another.
But you pay them no mind. The Maker's is the only judgment any man need fear.
Truly, I cannot thank you enough. Very well done indeed!

I spoke with Ser Mercedes. At times I feel I'm the only one focused on the true task at hand...
We came to Gransys not to fret but to slay a dragon, honoring the old pact among our nations.
Everyone ought clear their minds of any burden that would interfere.
As I understand it, Ser Mercedes brought no men with her from Hearthstone.
The force she commanded here was comprised of sellswords and the like.
I've no dislike of Ser Mercedes, nor any interest in ferreting out her secrets...
But the court is an ever-turning gyre of rumors...
Some claim she was sent alone as a conscious slight... Others, that her lord father was simply fain to be rid of her.
As a consequence, there are many here who shun her company.
I am sure you are a welcome ally, both as the Arisen and a fellow stranger to court society.
As a foreigner, same as she, I am in no position to make demands of you, ser...
But pray, do as you can for her.
I'll warrant your aid is a welcome boon to Ser Mercedes, Arisen. Pray, do as you can for her.
This place is...familiar.
This bears the look of...<cf>Of the world beyond the rift.
It feels different, yet...
Even we who traverse the rift do not ken<cf>what lies beyond.
Rifts are but gateways linking distant<cf>places...slivers of a world far more vast.
I am he who salts the wound. Your end shall not be quick. 
The ancient quarry lies ahead.
The path splits...
I see a gate, closed fast.
A gate. Closed, I fear...
We're like to find some mechanism to open it nearby.
Stepping on that panel ought open<cf>the door.
Dead end...
'Tis blocked tight.
Hmm. Last I was here, the quarry was deserted.
Such bounty...! 'Tis a prodigious<cf>lode sleeps here.
Perhaps the miners come here to rest?
Watch the ogre doesn't see you.
Seems this door only opens from the<cf>other side.
I fear it won't open from this side.
Pull the lever and the door will open.
Opening this door 'twill make<cf>travel from the south easier.
A hunk of meat left here may spare<cf>us the ogre's attention.
'Tis designed to open from the far<cf>side alone.
Seems it leads outside.
There's aught here, Arisen.
I was down in the markets not long ago, on errand from the larder.
Sure enough, food's grown scarce. Those stalls were packed with meat and fish once.
Just more proof we live in troubled times, I suppose.
Don't have the will for much of anything, truth be told.
Us lot never paid Salvation much mind...
An innocent bit of diversion for a day off, nothing more.
This rebellion business has all of us shaken. I never would've dreamed of such a thing.
I was down in the markets not long ago, on errand from the larder.
Sure enough, food's grown scarce. Those stalls were packed with meat and fish once.
Just more proof we live in troubled times, I suppose.
This is awful... Worse than I feared.
Ah!
Guah!
Eeaaagh...
Hoh!
Taaah!
Always a pleasure.
Till next time!
Oh, aye.
I'm of a different mind.
That's a kindness, ser.
I've rare known such happiness, ser.
Welcome, ser. Ah, the Arisen, is it?
The master will help you, ser.
Taking orders straight from the Captain of the Hunt, are you?
Then you're a proper Arisen, eh? Serving the people and all that.
We've seen a fair number of Arisen here, you see.
Some were good enough folk, but others just laid about all day, swilling ale.
Most folk think of the Arisen appearing in times of war.
Or when there's a dragon about, like now, I suppose...
Arisen come even in times of peace, or so I hear it told.
Seems once the pawns say a fellow's an Arisen, it's so.
But what measure do they use to judge by, I wonder?
You think it strange we've kept open, what with the dragon coming?
There's a fair bit of history to this place, ser.
Two generations back, the innkeeper housed the good Duke himself, right here.
No inn what housed Edmun Dragonsbane can close its doors because of a dragon, now can it?
Beat the dragon, then, did you?
You see that? I knew you for a proper Arisen.
Not a chance you're a traitor, ser. I won't hear of it.
I've rare known such happiness, ser.
Damned beasts... Yield, and accept your fate!
What of the men posted here? They've returned no word...
The hold was armed with a ballista... Maker preserve us if the beasts make use of it.
How was it this place fell...
'Tis hard to believe they've sent watchmen to do a soldier's job...
We'll see no others come to our aid. The duke's men are stretched thin everywhere.
Ah, Arisen! Ser! I find myself in a situation most dire...
I am in desperate need of coin, and quickly, but securing the funds has proved troublesome...
I beg you: Aid my cause!
Accept
Not now
Ah, Arisen! Ser! I find myself in a situation most dire...
I'd thought to sell some land I own to raise capital, but I must first evict those who live upon it.
This typically requires a rather involved procedure, but times are dire, and I wish the current residents gone with all haste.
They'll not hear this proposal from me, but from the Arisen, they're like to weigh it carefully.
You are my best and final hope in this matter. Can I rely upon your aid?
Accept
Not now
Ah ha! I wagered you'd agree, and I never lose a wager.
I find myself in dire need of coin, and quickly. I shall spare you the details -- suffice to say the situation is bleak.
I own a small parcel of land which could be sold for capital, but first I must evict those who live upon it.
Such things, however, take time, and my situation demands action of a more immediate sort.
In truth, my hope is for them to simply quit the land, and quietly besides.
They'll not hear this proposal from me, but from the Arisen, they're like to weigh it carefully.
Please, convince the residents that leaving quickly is in the best interest of all.
Ah ha! I wagered you'd agree, and I never lose a wager.
They'll not hear this proposal from me, but if it were to come from the Arisen, they're like to weigh it carefully.
Please, convince the residents that leaving quickly is in the best interest of all.
Is it not the charge of Arisen to assist all who seek aid!?
I am well and truly troubled, ser -- your refusal places me in great peril.
What news, Arisen? They agreed to leave? Wonderful!
Requesting your aid was indeed the proper course; now the land may be sold without delay.
You have done me a great service this day.
I pray this is but the beginning of a long and prosperous partnership 'tween you and I.
How goes your intervention? In truth, I'd hoped to have the matter settled by now...
However, as I have your ear... Perhaps you, Arisen, would purchase the land in question?
Such a thing would allow your mediation to continue apace, yet free me from further obligation.
<R_G>What say you? I shall, of course, require your payment in full...
Buy the land (<NOTE>80000</NOTE>G)
Refuse
'Tis but a matter of time ere I've a buyer for that property.
<R_G>...Though 'twould put a swift, sweet end to the matter if you purchased it, Arisen.
Buy the land (<NOTE>80000</NOTE>G)
Refuse
I see. Then may ask you to speed your negotiations?
Each day that passes with the land unsold adds a worry to my count.
Ah, Arisen! I knew you of all people would understand my plight.
Now my obligations are fulfilled, and the tenants need not quit the land.
I pray this is but the beginning of a long and prosperous partnership 'tween you and I.
Hold, Arisen. My land is worth more than what you offer.
I appreciate the thought, yes, but my creditors would not. It's gold they seek, and gold I must provide.
If that is the full weight of your purse, I must ask you remove the tenants after all.
What of the eviction dealings, ser?
Good Aldous told me there has been sign of thieving within the castle.
Even should they escape sight, the castle's construction hinders all who do not know it well.
Our villain had a guide... Or had some occasion to grow familiar with the castle.
Naught to do about it now, save forget and move on.
I lost my master, and with him what pale shadow of emotion I possessed...
I cannot even grieve him now. I simply remain, hollow... Empty.

An inquest, with the dragon near upon us?
Any fool could've guessed as much.
We lost a number of men, but others yet fight on ahead.
Please, ser, go to their aid!
Well, well... You've gone and felled the griffin!
It joys me to see a well-crafted stratagem bear fruit, though the men we lost sour the taste of it.
Pray, let us return to the capital and give word of our victory at once.
I shall remain here. There may be survivors yet.
I ask you return to Gran Soren ahead of me, Arisen. Tell them the beast is no more.
What is your purpose here, Arisen?
If you sought to live,
you had naught but run and hide yourself away.
But then, tell me, child of man...
What does it mean to live, in truth?
To wage war against the passing of days?
To pray to the unseen for a few breaths more?
To raise grand cities from stone<cf>and spawn new life in turn?
Mankind has done this, yes, and more.
But is the tapestry you weave<cf>truly of your own design?
We eats when 'ungry an' we sleep when tired from eatin'!
We kill them as we want dead,<cf>an' stick it in 'em as we want stuck!
Their kind is easy to fathom.
They go on living from simple fear of death.
But not mankind.
Some welcome the end with arms outstretched,
while others come to face death incarnate,<cf>arms in hand.
I ask again. What is your purpose here, Arisen?
One path to your survival lies in my defeat.
Still my heart, and you stay the coming end.
Another path before you...
Is to offer up that which you hold most dear.
Abandon all delusions of control.
For the price of a single life,<cf>I shall leave this land in peace.
As my vanquisher, the duchy would bow to you.
Wealth and power are sweet anodyne for heartache.
You'll not gainsay my terms are more than generous.
If it matters aught, the man who rules this land now
won that honor through just such a bargain.
The decision is yours, Arisen.
Now, choose!
It is as you see, Arisen. The Stone of the North crawls with the agents of Salvation.
The Night's Champion is a fearsome intellect. He authored and executed the scenario in full.
He scoured the duke's men for those with ties to Salvation, gathered them here, and sparked a revolt before anyone was the wiser.
Myself, I put no stock in Salvation's creed.
But the Champion claims the duke is lost in this war with the dragon, and in that I feel he speaks true.
I will not gainsay your mettle, ser, but even the Arisen is human. The wyrm cannot be slain.
Pray, forgive me. As a commander, I am duty bound to observe the conditions and exercise my best judgment.
I take no joy in crossing you, ser.
What do you think you're doing here?
Be off with you!
You great ass, away with you!
Are you brave? Or just mule-headed?
This is no place for the likes of you.
If you wish to travel with the Reaper, I'll gladly pay your toll.
I'm not of a mind to suffer fools... I am of a mind to make fools suffer.
Your brain must be dryer than a granny's...hmph.
Can't you bother someone else?
Stubborn as an ass, you are...
I trust you are well?
Hoy!
Bloodsuckers!
They've really done it now.
It beggars belief...
This insult cannot be allowed to stand.
Now: the perfect revenge...
Aye, that is so...
What?
I see...
And what then?
Ah!
Eyah!
Yaaaah...
Nh!
Yah!
Hello.
Goodbye.
Very well.
Absolutely not.
My, how charming.
Thank you, how wonderful!
What is it? I shall thank you not to approach me so brazenly.
'Tis a wide gulf of class stands between us. You would do well to remember that.
I am so dreadfully bored of everything...
Why do you suppose the dragon attacks mankind?
Are we a particular delicacy? Then, pray, what was it eating until now?
The duke and his men are all doing their best, I've no doubt...
But oft a man's best is far from enough.
The Arisen is not a post just anyone can fill.
Then, pray, how did you come to be chosen?
I... I'll not force you to speak on it. If you do not wish to...
The Wyrm Hunt is a farce... Do you really take yourself as a match for the beast?
I rather hope you do, for the city is full of fools with grand expectations for the great Arisen, such as you are...
I wish you the best of luck.
What is it? Is the Arisen truly so idle?
Fancy that. A savior with time to while away, chatting with girls. Quite impressive, really.
Know this, ser. I will see this debt repaid. I take charity from no one.
Yes? Haven't you more important matters to attend?
Or does your campaign afford you the leisure to fuss after every maiden you see?
...What?
I've no wish to look upon your murderous face!
'Tis over, now...
Father wasn't... He deserved better.
Father will not tell me anything... He says he does not want to cause me needless worry.
Even now he's been acquitted, the matter hangs overhead like a dark cloud.
Father...? Father, where are you?
So hungry...
Nh... I feel faint...
That chasm... Did you know the city would fall when you brought me here?
No... No, how could you?
Still... I thank you. 'Tis by your hand I'm still alive.
The world can crumble away to dust -- I've still my own life to live.
I've no time to waste on despair.
Fare well...
So much has changed... But an end can serve as a new beginning as well.
For Father's sake... And despair is a fool's escape, besides.
I suppose you had some hand in this, too. ...I thank you.
And I will repay my debt. I swear it.
Tell me, ser... Is this a dream?
It must be, for such a thing could never happen... Oh, sweet dream!
Thank you, how wonderful!

I sense a Wakestone, Arisen. 'Tis close.
Why not use the Wakestones, Master?
The Wakestones, Arisen.<cf>Grant him breath once more.
If we're to find these Wakestones, we'll<cf>first need information.
We've found enough. Let's head back.
My heart races. I know not why...
Our fealty is sworn to you, Arisen.
From this day, the legions men call "pawns"<cf>live and die by your command.
We'll be needing to tighten the watch.
I still can't believe it...
To the Arisen! May the path ahead e'er be clear!
Does His Grace seem slightly...off to you?
Don't you just love parties? Odd time for it, though.
Shall we continue this later, ser?
Enjoy yourself...but don't overdo it.

Hail, brother.
Naught to report?
Who is that!?
An impostor!
There's naught we can do... Naught but run.
Ah! Greetings, good Arisen. Have you any news of Quina?
She trains in the blessing of flowers, does she?
Then she bears the gifts of a healer! How wonderful.
I should like to see her handiwork. One look at such a flower is enough to glean the power of they who blessed it.
This is Quina's, then...?
How marvelous! It would seem she is gifted indeed.
Perhaps it will not be so long before the Mother Superior writes the mainland on Quina's behalf...
To think on it gives me joy. It was the Maker's hand guided her here to our church, I know it.

Good day.
Decided, Arisen?
Understood.
I thank you.
I am ever at your service.
Good fortune be upon you.
Yes.
No.
I fear you haven't enough, ser...
Pray, forgive me.
My mistress oft said the Arisen ought give charity, but never take it... I am sorry.
Well met, Arisen.
With her dying breath, my mistress bade me stay here...
And so this pawn lingers, that the meager offerings I've collected may serve future Arisen on their path.
I am sworn to my fallen mistress to aid the Arisen.
This pawn shall assist you to the best of my ability, Arisen.
I pray you will see my mistress's dreams realized.
The hopes of my fallen mistress go with you... I pray you will be the one to grant her rest.

Salvation, eh? Aye, I've heard the name often of late. And you're not the first to ask, besides.

Be serious, friend.
Ah, 'tis more than fair.
Leave it to me.
Ah, I near forgot. Here.
Very well.
Not possible.
Aye, what?
Leave me be for now.
'Tis hard to find reason to go on.
Dark clouds fill the horizon, and the hearts of men...
A man needs see to his own safety.
'Tis a mercy there's work to be found, given the times.
Everyone's desperate just to weather the storm.
'Tis enough to make you think twice of leaving home.
We've Edmun Dragonsbane watching over us. The duke will keep us safe.
A hard sight to stomach, that.

Perhaps we're being punished for some ill we've wrought...

Hoy, you there!
...What are they doing?
Damned beast!
Of all the disgusting beasts to deal with, why did it have to be goblins...
Maker knows what's happened to whoever's to be manning this post...
Maker's breath, there's a ballista in there...
If even this fort could fall, what's to become of the rest of us?
Even sentry work on the third shift is better than this...
Reinforcements? Heh. As if there were men to spare.
Retreaaat!
Pull back! Baaack!
We're ordered to turn back!
Run!
This is ever your home, and we your family. Come back to us any time you wish, minnow. 
Why are you here!?
Piss off!
Who d'you fancy you are?
You're not welcome here.
We don't suffer trespassers.
Eager to die, friend?
Be off with you!
You're daft, friend.
Have you naught better to do?
Still here, are you?
How do you fare?
Hoy!
Those rotten...
'Tis a poor jest...
...Truly?
We ought to have finished them earlier.
We'll do for them, we will...
Aye, we will...
What?
I see...
And what then?
You're keeping busy, eh? I hear there's aught on with the well?
If you've cause to handle a flame, pray, be careful. For all the water down there, the paths are narrow.
Take more care still if you mean to bring oil with you. Shower a bit of oil on it, and fire will take to just about anything.
You'll remember, won't you? I do not want to see you hurt.
Drive it back! That way!
You aren't too keen on living, are you.
Piss off.
Looking for a fight, are you?
Your stupidity beggars belief. Leave!
Aahn?
Don't waste your breath talking to me, and I won't have to waste my time killing you.
If you've no business here, move on.
Cause trouble here and you'll soon regret it.
Come to visit, friend?
You ought to join us! We wouldn't be too hard on you...
What? Who the hell are you?
Piss off!
Am I supposed to care you're "Arisen" or summat?
You're not wanted, get it?
Wanna find out what we do to trespassers?
I was just thinking about dealing someone bodily harm. Shall I start with you?
Bugger off!
You're as brazen a fool as any I've seen.
Don't you ever leave?
No one's killed you yet?
How goes it?
Hey!
Those pig-swiving, pox-stricken strumpets!
What're we to do about it?
Oho?
It's well past time to collect on these debts.
Now, what is the best way to make them bleed?
There's an idea!
Eh?
Ahh...exactly.
Then what?
Graaaaough...
Nagh...! Y...you...!
...Rraaaaaugh!
Yes...!
I... I must...feed! ...Slake my...hunger!
Your heart... Give it here!
Graaaagh! What... What is...!?
Agh... Ah!? Who... Who are you!?
What have I... I... Ngh? Waaaaugh!
(Slay your master!)
(Yield unto death!)
Gaaah... Augh... I... I'm...
(I am devourer!)
Ngh.
Hnngh...
Gagh...
Mh!
Mnnh!
I've awaited you.
Come whene'er you've the need.
Mm.
Nay...
I give you my thanks.
I'll accept no charity, though the thought is welcome.
All I know is yours to hear, should you desire it.
Tell me of the dragon.
Tell me of the Arisen.
Tell me of you, the Dragonforged.
Tell me of our hearts and our scars.
Another time, perhaps.
The beast is called death incarnate, the greatest of evils...
You will learn, when you come to face it, that the truth is not so simple.
It possesses deep insight to match its cold and steady drive to destruction.
And an air of...resignation, perhaps, lies beneath its imposing rage.
The Arisen is a child of man. No more, no less.
'Tis said the Arisen is born whene'er man takes his first true step toward a goal.
When the spirit gives rise to action, a man becomes Arisen.
Those, like us, whose paths lead to the dragon are known unto the beast as a matter of instinct.
Just as it is our own instinct that guides us on.
I am he who was forged in the dragon's fire.
I stand astride the bounds of life and death, remaining here that I may pass my knowledge on to the Arisen of each coming age.
My battle as the Arisen has spanned a thousand years and yet it knows no end.
Nor shall it, until the Arisen to follow me strikes the dragon dead.
Aye, ours are bodies marked by the wyrm, yours and mine.
A scar across the chest, to stand as proof of the dragon's claim over our hearts.
I carved a scarred man into the face of this hill, that it might serve as a beacon to those who bear our mark.
It beats yet, as does mine, there within the beast. A thousand years since it was stolen, and yet it beats...
As long as the dragon lives, the hearts in its safekeeping know no death.
Our kind may die in battle, aye, but neither age nor illness will ever claim us.
We have stepped free of this mortal coil, Arisen.
If that is your wish...
The Arisen needs know little, and needs do still less.
There is but one mantra you need hear, in truth: Follow your instinct.
I considered any bond with another being as a seed of doom for the Arisen.
I feared them for a weakness, and feared weakness above all...
And so I cast all ties aside and rose against the dragon in solitude. ...To this end.
Even now, I know not what I ought have done different. How I ought have faced my weakness...
Perhaps that doubt, above all, explains why I fell short.
Edmun? Did you speak the name Edmun?
...'Tis the name of the Arisen who came before you.
I know not how he turned away the dragon...
I bade him follow his instinct, same as I have bidden you.
That is all our kind can do, Arisen of the present day.
Continue forth from that first step, and never look back.
'Tis our duty, and our fate...
Though my own path stopped short, leaving me to linger on, an unsightly revenant...
Then your bond did prove a weakness...
My hour is past. Words can guide you no further...
Only you know what lies ahead, Arisen. Meet it without fear.
Go. There is naught to be gained from my words now... Indeed, heed no voice but your own.
Strain your ear to the voice within, Arisen. Heed it well.
Only you know what strength you hold.
But come, Arisen. Only speak, and I shall bare my knowledge to you.
...'Tis past, now. Speak, Arisen, and I shall bare my knowledge to you.
I give you my thanks.
Has Mirabelle spoken of our plans? We plot escape to our homeland of Meloire.
It saddens me to leave you, Arisen, but circumstance permits no other option.
Before we part, however, I would beg you one last favor: See me to safety. 
A Melorian envoy awaits outside the manse, but I've not the wherewithal to escape this place unaided.
Please, ser -- help me.
The main exit is far too perilous. We should take this way.
We must find a way back.
Perhaps a stair. A ladder...
The Guard!
Run!
Careful!
Look out!
Stop! No!
No...
Yaah!
No!
Help me!
Stay away from me!
We must escape at once.
Pursuit is at our heels. We must press on.
Worry not, Arisen. I shall survive.
I...I apologize. This place is unfamiliar to me.
Oh! ...It seems that we've found the way out in the nick of time.
I'm sorry, I... I cannot possibly cross here.
Might you...carry me across?
Oh!
It's s-so cold.
It would appear we have a choice to make.
I know not which path is true... I leave final judgment to you.
Yes... Yes! Truly, this is the way!
The exit lies just beyond! We're nearly there!
Step lightly, Arisen. This bridge is old beyond imagining.
Best we crossed swiftly.
I ill trust this bridge.
A stone to recall the dead to living? You speak of Wakestones, Arisen.
Stones red as blood, ensorceled with arcane magick. The Reaper's Scorn, they're also called.
Strange you should mention it: I heard tell a traveling merchant found one in a cave not a few days past.
It may come to naught, but you might seek the stone on the shelves of Gran Soren's shops.

What is that...?
I've never seen its like...
It does not seem human...<cf>'Tis certainly no pawn.
It hunts with others of its kind...
They appear to roam in packs.
There... The undead, master!
I sense a horde of undead nearby.
They are men no longer...<cf>'Twould be a mercy to destroy them.
Let us give them a proper burial!
Look there! Undead!
Undead... They pose no threat.
Let us strike with fire!
If they hate fire, they'll loathe this!
They fear the flames...<cf>wreathe your weapons in them!
Oil might make fire<cf>still more effective...
Purge them with holy magick!
Holy light will decide this!
Let's slay the lot of them with holy magick!
We need sacred light...<cf>I'll enchant our weapons!
Now, while it's down! Attack!
I'll finish it where it fell!
Now! It's fallen!
Finally!
This will finish it where it lies!
I'll hold nothing back!
I'll finish it with a chain of blows!
I'll rain attacks upon it!
End it with a torrent of attacks!
Hold it still! This blow will end it!
Hold fast! I'll throw all I have at it!
Hold it still! I'll rain blows upon it!
Hold fast!<cf>I'll unleash a volley of blows!
Don't let go till I've pummeled the<cf>creature!
Hold it still! I'll attack its head!
Hold fast!
Its head is vulnerable...<cf>I'll cleave it in two!
Hold it still! I'll visit a flurry of blows<cf>upon its head!
Hold fast! I'll strike its head with a<cf>salvo of blows!
Its head is weak...<cf>I'll unleash a flurry upon it!
Undead!
A horde of undead!
There, Master! The undead!
A walking dead, there!
A stout undead!
A horde of stout undead!
There, Master! Stout undead!
There -- a stout undead!
A company of undead warriors!
There, Master! Undead warriors!
An undead warrior there, Master!
Giant undead!
A horde of giant undead!
There, Master! Giant undead!
A giant undead spotted!
Don't allow them to swarm!
I can't but envy their endurance!
They hardly falter in their assault!
I'll split it open with fire!
Now! Use fire to pop it!
Stand clear! I'll use fire to burst it!
I'll burst it open. Stand clear, Arisen!
That stench... Repulsive...
Waugh! Master, the corpses...!
Those raiments... Gran Soren guards?
There must be some stratagem...
I sense unnatural forces about...<cf>The undead.
Wait... Something's amiss with that<cf>one.
If we could engulf other foes<cf>in the blast...
A woman...or what remains of one.
Is someone there...?
Banshee!
Ahead, ser! Banshee!
A cacophany of banshees!
Banshees are more apt to freeze than other<cf>dead!
Magick is little good on their kind.
Their shrieks are torturous!
Slay them ere they can slow us down!
That voice...'tis white-hot pain!
Begin with the banshees!
Only death can silence a banshee!
A banshee walks among them! Take care!
Augh, the air goes rank!
'Tis a massive undead!
Poisoned undead!
Poisoned undead come!
A horde of poisoned undead!
They spew a noxious venom!
Their poison makes close combat foolhardy!
They've the toughness to match their size...
Their poison saps the strength from its<cf>victims!
It looks damned tough...
A guardian of this labyrinth, perhaps.
Eliminator!
Stand firm! An eliminator comes!
A company of eliminators!
Magick will avail!
They're tough as stone...!
They charge with little warning!
Naught I do makes them flinch!
Such inhuman power!
They swarm upon the fallen! Rise as soon<cf>as you're able!
Watch for their attacks--evade, then strike!
Striking the head is useless!
I am she who turns the wheel eternal. Your final thought shall be of me.
'Tis deep...
From here, we can see what's below.
It's too narrow to pass through.
We'll get nowhere till we've found<cf>that key.
Would that we could get this lift<cf>moving...
There must be some device to<cf>activate the lift.
Hmm... Conventional means won't see<cf>us across.
'Tis well flooded...
Let's drain this water as well.
Saurians! We'll cut them down where<cf>they stand!
More saurians, Arisen!
No way forward but o'er their corpses!
Hm... A mechanism of some sort...
This ought to drain the water.
This will buy us entrance to the<cf>flooded area.
Master -- a chest, up ahead!
There's aught further in...
Scholars of the Faith gave the Watergod's<cf>Altar its name, not long ago.
'Twas a place of worship and training,<cf>once, for clerics of the old gods.
Or so they say. In truth, no one knows<cf>for sure who built this place, or why.
The ruins are half-flooded...
If the water were gone, we might pass...
Uh.
Guh!
Waaaugh...
Huh!
Eagh!
'Tis an honor, ser.
By your leave.
Yes, yes.
No, no, far from it.
My, that is kind of you.
My, my, my! What a treat, ser!
I am called Mirabelle, ser.
Lady in waiting to my mistress, Aelinore, newly come to this place as His Grace's bride. A duchess now, she is.
'Tis a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Arisen.
My mistr...er, the Duchess and I are come from Meloire, north in Auldring.
Come all this way to a foreign land to wed. Mistress Aelinore, that is, not I. I never did marry...
But yes, freshly come as a bride and the dragon attacks! 'Tis ill<cf>fortune, is it not?
My...the Duchess ne'er was blessed with good fortune. Even as a child.
I say milady needs learn speak her mind more frankly, if I may be so bold as to say.
Always too gentle, that one. Too eager to please. And she's e'er been left holding the short straw for it.
Even the business of this present marriage. Oui, Duke Edmun is<cf>the hero slayed the dragon in his day...
But his day is long past, if you'll forgive me saying, and he hardly has a face to swoon for...
Oh, but my tongue runs loose!
You've a commoner's mien, Arisen, that I fear has got me to gossiping like an old hen.
Silence is golden, so the saying goes. I shall still my mouth awhile.
You've a commoner's mien, Arisen, that I fear has got me to gossiping like an old hen.
Silence is golden, so the saying goes. I shall still my mouth awhile.
Ah, the good Arisen is returned! Welcome, ser. Welcome.
For all your busy travels, you always come around to speak to me. 'Tis very sweet, really.
...I only jest, ser. I know you are come to speak with milady Aelinore.
No doubt I've said it before, but His Grace has left my mistress<cf>so very alone these days since they were wed.
I suppose she is but the next in a long line of brides to him, but<cf>to her... Well, you know.
And all this after coming so far from home, not knowing a soul, what's more.
To have you come and visit with such frequency is no doubt<cf>a relief to her.
And I must confess, I've seen a sparkle to the mistress' eye when<cf>she speaks of you.
Such company is a blessing, really. All the more for someone so far removed from kith and kin.
Greetings to you, Arisen. Have you met with my mistr...the Duchess Aelinore?
Such a beauty, oui? Even back in Meloire's court, she was famed<cf>for her fair looks.
I've had the privilege of tending to her since she was but a child, and still I fawn over her as if she were my own blood.
And now, to see the child I hold so close gone and wed in such a foreign land...
Ought to have been a grand wedding, too, I should think. A feast,<cf>if nothing else.
But with the dragon come, 'tis not the time for such revels... Truly, the mistress has e'er been an unlucky child!
Bad enough their marriage should go without celebration, these days the duke scarce finds time to speak with her.
Oui, with the dragon come, he's important matters to tend to,<cf>but still...
The man is old, I know, but 'tisn't right to neglect one's own new bride so, if you'll pardon me saying.
What cruel rebuke is this, Arisen? Haven't the time to aid a woman in need, then?
I'll sooner ask the wyrm next I need a favor. See if I don't!
Times are grim. More than ever, a person need mind what they say.
A flippant rumor can see a fellow hang, times like these.
My word... 'Tis enough to leave you speechless.
Mistress! Mistress Aelinore, your faithful Mirabelle is here!

Ngh!
Gyurk!
Aaargh...
Hah!
Hyagh!
Hey!
See ya soon.
Sure!
No...
Whoa, thanks!
Woohoo! Thanks!
Them beasts will burn the whole world up, way I see it. Save someone can stop 'em...
I heard the news! They say you're to set off on a fantastic journey.
How exciting to travel the world! You've just got to tell me of the amazing sights you see when you come back!
Ay! You've returned! ...Did you bring me anything?
Gran Soren? Wow...
So what was the capital like? Did you see the duke?
Wow! Someday I hope to look on Gran Soren with my own two eyes...
Ay, anyplace else you travel, promise you'll come tell me of it, too, right?
So, where'd you go this time? Was it fantastical? Were there jesters and merry-makers and maidens most fair?
You went out to the Stone of the Southwest?
Those goblins must've run away crying when first they got a look at you!
You saw the ancient quarry?
They say that place is crawling with monsters, too.
I also heard tell of a hill, north of the capital...
They say it's got the likeness of a man carved into its side. Have you seen such?
I so envy you and your travels...
I always figured I'd grow up and take up the net; be a fisherman, just like my pa...
But not anymore! I'll be an Arisen like you, and travel the land, slaying foul creatures and aiding all who suffer!
What happened at the Greatwall? Were you there to see it? Was it terrible as Pa says!?
My pa says the Greatwall was built to keep us safe from monsters.
He says the dragon tainted the lands to the west, turning everything out there...unnatural...
Them monsters must be fearsome indeed. Just thinkin' on it gives me the shivers...
You travels ever take you far north of here?
They say past the mountains there's a path to the mainland. Hope to see it for myself, someday.
My pa told me of dragons what attack the mainland, too.
Them beasts will burn the whole world up, way I see it. Save someone can stop 'em...
The dragon is defeated? You've won the day!? 
Do you feel different? Are you still Arisen?
Will you head to the mainland and wipe out them dragons, too?
Wow... There's a great hole below the capital? I wanna see.
So you're heading beyond the rift?
Well, you'll be back, aye? Sure, I know you will, same as always.
I so envy you and your travels...
Woohoo! Thanks!
Master!
...MASTER!
Thank you.
I'd given up hope of seeing you again.
In any form!
It's clear that forces beyond my ken<cf>are at work here...
But I'll ask no questions. Not today.
I've seen you fight, ser. I'm not fool enough to cross you.
Know that this hold fell long before the first blood was spilled. 
'Twas the Night's Champion who won it. A man of that "Salvation" lot.
Seems his aim was simply to bring chaos to the land.
You are blind to the truth, Arisen!
Perdition is nigh! The hour of redemption is upon us!
All will burn, and through fire return to nothingness!
In the name of Salvation, the world must know chaos. The world must know destruction!
State your business!
Who goes there!?
Where d'you think you're going?
Halt!
You'll go no farther!
M-my deepest apologies...
What brings you here, ser?
I cannot allow even the Arisen to pass unbidden.
I would thank you to refrain from such actions in the future, ser...
Flowers for medicine, is it? The same compound Benita's long made, no doubt.
As I recall, it was made of a common blossom, paired with one more rare.
She spoke of the exceptional flower growing where the sea breeze blows, and that it only blooms with the light of the moon...
If that's so, you'll not find it sprouting among the roadside grasses, nor by day. Best you search at night, cousin.
Where do the curing flowers grow? Hmm...
Have you had a look by the shore? If not now, by night, perhaps?
I recall seeing some the eve of the last full moon...
We followed it here, but...it caught us unawares...
Still...the beast, too, is wounded deep. It will fall ere much<cf>longer...
Please... See that this tower marks...the creature's grave...
I've heard tell that Fournival stands trial.
None's the pity. I fancy myself the forgiving sort, but I'll not mourn his passing.
I'm scarce the only one he's wronged, either. The man built his fortune on the backs of honest folk.
I'll gladly add my name to a petition if it means no others need suffer at his hands.
A man's life is at stake. Villain or no, I do not sign this petition lightly.
But the chain of suffering must be broken. On this occasion, I'll leave mercy for the Maker.
My master left this afore succumbing to death's embrace...
'Tis meaningless to me now. Pray, take it.
Decided, Arisen?
Understood.
I thank you.
I am ever at your service.
Good fortune be upon you.
Yes.
No.
I fear you haven't enough, ser...
Pray, forgive me.
My mistress oft said the Arisen ought give charity, but never take it... I am sorry.
Well met, Arisen.
With her dying breath, my mistress bade me stay here...
And so this pawn lingers, that the meager offerings I've collected may serve future Arisen on their path.
I am sworn to my fallen mistress to aid the Arisen.
This pawn shall assist you to the best of my ability, Arisen.
I pray you will see my mistress's dreams realized.
The hopes of my fallen mistress go with you... I pray you will be the one to grant her rest.
<SHOP>Choose as you will, ser.
Buy
Sell
Never mind
I am ever at your service.
I thank you.
I am ever at your service.
Good fortune be upon you.
May your path be straight and true, Arisen.
And may you continue to be a boon to Gransys.
I daresay I'm not the only man who wonders why the dragon's coming invites revelry.
Yet, perhaps His Grace hopes to keep his people from despair.
If Duke Edmun judges morale that important, I'll attempt to enjoy myself.
A word, ser!
Are you the Arisen? I bring a message from the duke himself.
His Grace has judged your feat in slaying the hydra most laudable.
To honor your noble works, you are hereby welcomed to the Wyrm Hunt.
You may now accept orders from Ser Maximilian, Captain of the Hunt.
Bring this writ to Ser Maximilian, outside the castle gates. He will instruct you further.
That document confers the status of hunter upon you. Carry it on your person always.
A cloud of unease hangs o'er the land these days.
Who's a fellow to turn to?
Don't have the will for much of anything, truth be told.
Who's a fellow to turn to?
'Tis... 'Tis overwhelming!
Seems we've found this maze's master!
The horns, the wings, the tail... It wears<cf>the aspects of the dragon!
A daimon, come from another world!
Daimon!
Ready for hell--'tis a Daimon!
A diablerie of Daimons!
The fiend's form changes!
King of all the dark...
Blows to the head ought prove effective!
The great head sprouting from its belly<cf>controls the rest!
Strike at the face upon its belly!
Its guard is tight...
Such evil ought be weak to holy light!
A flurry of spells comes from overhead!
It strikes from the air!
Evade its attacks--the rest can wait!
Get swallowed up and it's all over!
'Tis too strong to be this fast!
Dragon's breath?!
That portal it opens... Is that the Rift?!
A massive Rift... 'Tis like naught we've<cf>seen before!
Distance will not spare you from it's<cf>claws!
It's claws rend the very fabric of reality!
I'll stop its incantation!
It cannot be long, now! Surely...!
Stand as far from that tear as you're<cf>able!
Now! 'Tis spent!
If we bind it now, we may stay its<cf>onslaught!
Quickly! Bind it!
Just what does it aim to do?!
Brute force and magick...and both well<cf>lethal!
'Tis a Rift, I'm certain! But how...?
The fiend's aura is... 'Tis like that of<cf>the Arisen.
'Tis not the same creature...<cf>I sense the dragon!
A nightmare... 'Tis a nightmare made real...
Perhaps we'd best return to the inn<cf>at Gran Soren.
Let's speak with Asalam.
This is who we're looking for.<cf>Let's report back to Asalam.
Perfect. Let's return to Asalam.
Seems we were mistaken.
Let's find another.
I've never met the one Asalam seeks.
Hmm, none that I know meet Asalam's<cf>conditions...
Who shall we bring, Master?<cf>I'm afraid I've no idea...
I fear I know no one who fits the<cf>description.
I've met one who fits that description.
If those are his terms, I've met<cf>a likely fit.
We'll need a good description and a healthy store of<cf>patience.
If we seek a pawn, we might try the rift, Arisen.
Manhunts present their own unique challenges... Shall<cf>we try another?
'Tis like finding a single grain of sand...<cf>Next time, surely.
Pay their words no heed! They're liars, all!<cf>Their black tongues will be your doom...
I am not afeared to die in this place... But I<cf>would not wish this fate on any other.
I gave body and soul to this cause, and for<cf>what...? Damn the Arisen, like as the dragon!
I believed myself the one to end the great cycle. To free the world... Yet here I reach my meager end, lost in quiet oblivion.
Guh.
Gwaugh!
Gwaaaugh...
Hah!
Rra-ha!
How fare you?
Fare well, then.
Aye, that is so.
You are wrong there.
My thanks.
You have my thanks, ser.
Pawns serve their purpose in times like these, I'll grant you.
But that's no cause to march them about the streets.
Use them, cast them away in battle if you like, but keep your puppets out of the city.
If they'll not learn where they do not belong, that burden falls on you.
Duke Edmun was an Arisen in his day, attended by pawns of his own.
What has become of them, I wonder?
As I hear it, the pawn legion does not age, or ail, or die, long as their master draws breath.
So, how do you fare with the pawns at your back?
I've no great love for their kind, but I suppose you find use enough for them?
I'll take the true humans under my command to your mindless dolls just the same.
A master worth his salt can keep order among men just as well, besides.
You have my thanks, ser.
There! Steady on, men!
Benita's back to her herbs, is she? Seems it's been an age...
Was a time, she gathered flowers every day. 'Tis a rare girl sees more than beauty in their petals.
I recall them blooming all around the roots of the village trees on sunny days, though I've not seen near so many of late.
They just as like still bloom along the roads, but you'll not see me braving the monsters to pick flowers.
Gathering ingredients, eh?
You oft see those flowers growing at the roots of bigger trees. Not that I'm fain to brave the roads these days... 
Just see you're not injured yourself, goodfisher.
I was always so afraid... You seemed ever like to leave for somewhere I could not follow.
Coming home is not running away, cos.
All I asked was to...be at the side of those I loved... All I...ever asked...
What do you think you're doing here?
...Why are you still in my presence?
What is your problem, friend?
May I have no respite from you?
I love intruders. Gives me a chance to work on my bladework.
Don't think I won't take the opportunity to put you in your place.
How can I be free of this clouted barnacle!?
I'd wager your head is even harder than my steel.
If all work were as slack as Arisening must be, I might've kept a legal job!
You may be the most mule-headed person I've ever met.
How go your travails?
Hallo!
Audacious harlots...spawned from the Dragon himself!
This really is the last straw, this time.
...For true?
Now...now is the time to strike, for true and for all.
'Tis merely a question of how, when, and where...
Mm-hmm...
What?
Understood...
Then?
Merciful Maker, I am glad to see you, ser.
Their leader is just beyond. Pray, go and put him to the blade!
Ah, but first, take what you will from the storeroom. 'Tis the least we can offer you.
Ohh.
Whoa!
Nrrrgh...
Hnh.
Shah!
Salutations.
Fare well.
Hmm, yes, that's so.
Absolutely not!
Ahh, my thanks, ser.
Ho ho! I am touched, ser. Thank you.
Mm? Did you say something?
Do not confuse the old with the idle. I've no time for this.
Longevity can seem a curse when it means living to see such times.
Another dragon? Once was enough...
I'll not rest my hopes on any Arisen.
All we can do is wait for the storm to pass.
What can one person do, truly?
Ahh, the horror... The horror of it...
Ahh, my thanks, ser.
Vengeance on these accursed beasts!
What of the men posted here? They've returned no word...
Holds like this have heavy weaponry...this does not bode well for us.
How could this have happened?
Let's finish this matter quickly.
This is becoming all too common of late...
Retreaaat!
Pull back! Baaack!
We're ordered to turn back!
Run!
By the duke's decree, we spare no effort in gathering knowledge concerning the wyrm.
As one arm of that pursuit, we aid the Faith in their examination of ruins and relics.
One such ruin has of late become home to monsters. We've received a request for escort.
They've asked for you by name, ser. What response might I give them?
Accept
Not now
My thanks, ser. His Grace has commanded the utmost attention be given to such matters.
Pray, speak to Father Geffrey at the cathedral in the city for details of the task.
Were the decision mine, I would set every man we have to defending our strongholds...
But such is our duty.
I understand... 'Tis a pity, ser.
The duke grows anxious upon hearing of any such survey as may yield new knowledge of the wyrm.
No growth in the numbers of our force buys him ease... A product of his experience, no doubt.
He is a hero -- the only one fit to rival the beast. There is a weight in that we cannot fathom.
...I was remiss in speaking so lightly. 'Tis not the place of a soldier to counsel his commander.
You have my thanks, ser. Terrible thing, what happened to that monk. ...There was naught for it.
The Faith, as all humankind, are victims in the madness wrought by the dragon's coming.
That fear of the wyrm should drive a man to die in pursuit of old stones... I forget myself.
At day's end, the duke has gained more of the knowledge he so ardently seeks. 'Tis a victory.
That way! Quickly!
Hail, brother.
Naught to report?
Who is that!?
An impostor!
What are you doing, man!? Make haste!
Good day.
Decided, Arisen?
Understood.
I thank you.
I am ever at your service.
Good fortune be upon you.
Yes.
No.
I fear you haven't enough, ser...
Pray, forgive me.
My mistress oft said the Arisen ought give charity, but never take it... I am sorry.
Well met, Arisen.
With her dying breath, my mistress bade me stay here...
And so this pawn lingers, that the meager offerings I've collected may serve future Arisen on their path.
I am sworn to my fallen mistress to aid the Arisen.
This pawn shall assist you to the best of my ability, Arisen.
I pray you will see my mistress's dreams realized.
The hopes of my fallen mistress go with you... I pray you will be the one to grant her rest.

I am the void of stygian black. I am wonder and despair. I am annihilation.
You stood tall against my Nameless Men, Arisen.
But you will find my challenge of a different caliber. I am the great darkness -- part of every thing, part of every one...
And I am your doom.
Ngh!
Aah!
Ayaaaah...
Ngh!
Hyegh!
How are you?
Maker speed your steps.
Oh, certainly.
No, no...
Oh! Thank you.
This is...wonderful.
Ah...
Fortune sees fit for us to live in interesting times.
Imagine, our village playing host to a dragon...
Had I foreseen the beast's visit, I'd have quit this village for the next and married the first man I laid eyes on.
I suppose it matters little where I reside, doesn't it now?
Even should I flee the village, the dragon could easily follow.
My father says fortune has a plan for us all; that we should simply live as best as we are able.
My mother is consumed by black thoughts of late. She oft speaks of the dragon's return...
Many claim the beast sleeps after each assault. Were that it's so...
Should I survive, I shall find a good man and take him for a husband.
Family is needed in times such as these. A husband...children... Perhaps even a grandchild or two, in time...
I take comfort in my youth, for I know children are in my future.
Even should the entire village be put to the torch, something of us shall live on and endure.
My mother claims to fear death no more, long as I survive her.
I will bear children one day, and so, she says, the chain of life grows on.
Mother is hale and hearty, mind -- death will not claim her easily.
But her words warm my heart all the same. The link between parent and cub is truly a bond stronger than steel.
You defeated the dragon? For true!?
Maker be praised... I had resigned this village to doom, but the light of hope shines once more.
With the dragon fallen, my thoughts may return to more dire matters...
Finding a husband, to name one.
When I bear a child, I shall gift it with your name.
Should my spawn manage a sliver what you've accomplished, I would consider it a grand thing.
How are you?
This is...wonderful.
Now, choose. Stand against me, or speak your<cf>wish.
Offer your beloved in forfeit, and I shall see your<cf>will done.
Choose? How am I to choose?
No matter my answer, the price is death.
A hollow choice... Who am I to stand as<cf>arbiter of two lives?
...Of two loves.
What would you have me do?
You brought me here. You...
If this be the will of the gods... The order<cf>of the world... Then damn the lot of them!
No matter my answer... A hollow choice... Who am I to...<cf>What would you... If this be the will of the gods...
I'll tear the whole of it asunder!
Very well... If that be your wish, I shall claim my<cf>price.
Stop! NOOOOOO!
Aaaaaaugh!
Ser Mercedes should be ready by now.
Captain Mercedes's preparations are<cf>likely complete.
We had best check our supply of<cf>medicines...we may have need of it.
We must see that the freight reaches<cf>the capital safely.
Stay at the cart's side!
Allow no monster to approach the<cf>cart!
Protect the cart!
Watch both ground and sky for<cf>threats...
This place is home to harpies...
Goblins come!
We'll never fell them all.<cf>We should press on!
Let us go!
We made it through!
Stay vigilant. There's yet a ways to go.
Another waycastle lies between us and<cf>the capital.
This is the final waycastle before<cf>Gran Soren!
'Tis but a trice to the capital<cf>from here.
Onward!
The capital is in sight.
The cottage ahead oft holds curatives.
We need this gate open. Let's have a<cf>look around.
There must be a way to...<cf>There. Beside the gate.
Don't let them get at the cart!
We may find aught of use in the<cf>cottage ahead.
There must be a mechanism to open<cf>the gate. Is there naught nearby?
Gran Soren, capital of Gransys. Shall<cf>we enter, Arisen?
Let us check the map.
This path will take us to the waycastle.
We've near arrived!
Not that way.
We're here.
Ngh.
Hnngh...
Aaaugh...
Hah!
Eagh!
Business with the guild, ser?
Until next time.
Yes.
No.
I thank you, ser.
You have my deepest appreciation.
'Tis strange... Wondrous strange, ser.
Deep within, we knew of your coming. We believed you would arise.
And so we too are come, led by our unbending faith in the Arisen.
You need spare us no effort, ser. We are yours to command.
The pawn legion are without self, void of any independent will.
We bear no desires, no ambition...naught which impels human kind to aggrandize the self.
And so human kind has taken to using us, else shunning us entirely. But always making clear distinction between our kind and theirs.
Some of our number have suffered terribly at the hands of man...
But even such abuses rouse no hate, no rage within us, for there is none to rouse for good or ill.
Our kind can learn and grow, but our hearts, such as they are, remain ever constant. A pawn ne'er doubts, ne'er betrays.
And so we are seen as convenient tools of war. That is the office we occupy at present.
In that, at least, we have found rest... Or stability, perhaps. We exist in equilibrium with human kind.
It cheers me to see you well, Arisen.
Such a monster, so close to His Grace... Truly, Salvation cannot be suffered to continue unchecked.
This pawn has stood watch here for two score years, but never once have I seen such as this...
I know not the cause, nor what meaning this holds... I fear I know naught at all.
Perhaps we were never meant to know.
The pawn legion stands astride this world and others. Our bond to this place is less even than the humans who live here.
We come and go and put down no roots. Perhaps we are without them in the first place...
Your fear of the unknown, your uncertainty in troubled times -- all of this is proof that you are human, ser.
Would that I could understand your tumult, and share in it with you.
You have my deepest appreciation.

Welcome, Arisen. We have awaited your coming.
This pawn is called Barnaby. I tend to the affairs of the Pawn Guild.
The guild serves as a place of rest for pawns, and as the gate to the Everfall.
The Everfall lies beneath Gran Soren. 'Tis a place of great importance to our kind.
But for now, let us rejoice in the coming of the Arisen, the light that guides the legion.
'Tis locked. You haven't the key to fit it...
'Tis caught on something. Perhaps it could open from the far side.
'Tis barred shut. Might be able to break the bolt.
'Tis shut tight.
'Tis no use at this hour. You'll have to come again later.
Best stop for now.
Seems they're closed.
Someone was here...
Lost them...
Gone...
Perhaps you've upset them.
There's naught to do here.
Best you moved on.
Not here...
The door is closed.
Shows no sign of opening.
There's aught there...
You don't see anything.
That smell...
Someone's near...
What's this...?
Fine view from here.
There's aught written here...
Must be a way to find something...
Smells delicious.
Perfect spot to place something.
You can almost reach...
There appears to be aught ahead.
That fall could kill.
'Tis dangerous to touch.
A strong blow might break it.
Perhaps if you came by night.
Perhaps if you came by day.
Perhaps if you came at dawn.
Perhaps if you came at dusk.
There's aught buried here...
You see no way up.
'Tis slick, this spot.
No use pressing any further.
No need to double back further.
No time for that now.
You cannot carry any more.
There may yet be aught lying about.
Seems there's naught you can take on at present.<cf>Best to try again later.
Perhaps with a bit of help...
Best you kept your weapon sheathed.
Is someone here...?
'Tis a place for tall folk.
'Tis a place for small folk.
Had you a woman in your band...
Had you a man in your band...
Had you a strong companion...
Had you a swift companion...
Had you a magick user...
Had you an apt climber...
Had you a skilled jumper...
This weapon will not help you.
That armor won't protect you.
You're ill equipped for this.
Seems it can't be used now.
You'll get no further use from it.
'Tis useless, now.
Hmm, not with your current equipment...
Not with your current party...
You hear aught from further in.
Enemies... They're close.
Best you got some rest.
You can carry no more!
You're too exhausted!
"Danger! Keep Out!"
"No Trespassing"
A sign.
Had you an Empty Flask, you might fill it here.
You'll get no further without a lantern.
'Tis dangerous to fumble about in the dark. Best find a light.
Best not just leave them.
If aught were left here, it would rot.
Best take care you don't get lost.
Best check the map.
You're due for a rest.
This place is dangerous by night.
This place is dangerous by day.
Breathtaking...
You'll get no further!
Seems you'll need to come back.
Nothing left here.
It looks fit to crumble.
Seems it could be moved...
It will not budge.
It will not open.
Seems you need a key.
Seems you need a Pickaxe here.
You yet lack the experience.
You yet lack the skill.
Not with your current vocation...
You'll not pass through this gate.
You've no time!
Seems you were too late.
You may make it, yet.
You're doing well for time.
Seems you've come at the wrong time.
There may be another path.
'Tis a powerful weapon... Too bad it doesn't work.

Begone! Away with you!
She's in with the dragon!
Seize her!
This is her devilry!
Those Salvation bastards show an unnatural unity in their actions.
There are good men left within the hold. I wish there were aught I could do to help them...
Maker be praised... My thanks, ser.
I'd given up hope for a time there.
I am in your debt.
Well glad to see you, Arisen.
They've laid traps further on, ser. Pray, take care.
I will join you, ser.
Bah, I'm still fit to fight!
'Tis massive!
An ogre... Of all the poor luck...
Ogres are bloodthirsty brutes!
As dangerous as they are barbaric,<cf>ogres!
Its brute strength is deadly!
Their raw power makes them a threat!
Careful, they're fast for all that muscle!
Its kind targets women over all others!
Stay ready. It will come at women first!
We must ransom her afore it's too late!
Now, while it's busy with me!
It cowers! Continue the attack!
It cowers! I'll strike it down!
Now, aim for the head!
Put it to sleep and we'll have<cf>ample time to strike.
It hungers for humans.<cf>Women, most of all.
Its hunger knows no end.<cf>Keep your distance!
It can't be stopped once it begins<cf>to rage!
'Tis more vicious than a cyclops!
I'll drag it to the ground when<cf>it attacks!
Take care when scaling its back!
A sacrifice may spare the rest of us...
What's... 'Tis wroth!
No! It means to eat them!
Arisen! Do we give chase!?
Wh-what is that...? A giant?
'Tis well smaller than a cyclops.
Seems a man in women's kit is close<cf>enough for its tastes.
W-waaaugh! No! Let--
Counter after it strikes!
Grab hold and pull it down!
Seems it doesn't care for the taste<cf>of men. 
The sight of women excites it.
No! We must give help!
I'll keep it down!
Watch for its counterattacks!
'Tis flush red with anger!
Its kind loves women above all.<cf>Be ready.
'Tis become swifter?!
'Tis defenseless on the ground! Go!
Truly, a revolting sight...
An ogre? ...Hmm, but 'tis different.
Elder ogre!
An elder ogre! Stand ready!
A council of elder ogres!
They attack men with especial zeal!
'Tis more brutish still than a normal ogre!
Elder ogres bow to lightning's kiss!
'Tis fixated on men alone!
Seems the beast hungers for men!
Seems the sight of men excites it to<cf>frenzy...
It disfavors the taste of a woman!
Elder ogres favor men for prey!
Ugh, the beastman feeds upon corpses...
They make a banquet of rotting flesh.
No! Break free of its grip!
It's on its knees! Strike now!
Let go!
It's fallen! Now! Attack!
The beast reels!
Now! Knock it off balance!
Almost there...
Not long now... Attack!
I'll scale its head!
I'll climb to its head!
'Tis fearsome wroth.
Ogre!
A family of ogres!
There, Master! Ogres!
A giant, Master! Ready yourself!
Don't allow it to take hold!
Anything it catches it devours!
Now, while it's doubled-over!

'Tis a simple choice, Arisen:
Step forward, or retreat.
Accept the quiet emptiness of a false peace. Of false life.
Do you think them an illusion, Arisen? Are you so certain?
Will you sever all ties with the world you have known to reach me?
Then you would choose peace? ...That, too, is a valid fate.
Leave now, and you will never again come to see this place.

Escape from Enemy Territory
Hoy, goodfisher. I've a favor to ask, if you've the time to listen.
'Tis a matter of warding the village from crime. I would ask your help.
Hear him out
Not now
Aye, I knew I could rely on you.
Truth be told, the crime is already come. A thief, cousin.
He strikes the same spots each time. Heraldo's grocery and Aestella's apothecary have suffered, as I have.
The rat steals in anights and pinches the food and vital stores we've gathered for times of need.
A skilled wretch, too, and well crafty. There is a strict order to his thieving.
I've spoken with the others and we've agreed upon a plan to catch our rat.
They are none too pleased at this violation, and eager to be quit of it. Best you go and speak with them.
Come and find me after. I will explain the plan.
Aye...? Another time, then. As you like.
Still, know that I would welcome your help.
Please, cousin? We cannot manage without you.
Ready, are you? Then I'll explain.
He's fearsome fleet of foot, dashing about the village as he goes about his business.
When the thief arrives, you'll give chase, goodfisher.
And we'll have those pawns of yours keep watch outside the village.
With luck, you'll catch him with ease, and before he can pinch any more of our wares.
Well? Questions, cousin?
Pray, speak with me once you've finished preparations for<cf>tonight.
Done with your preparations, goodfisher? There's time, yet. Or are you ready to rest until night?
All is ready.
I need more time.
Then we wait. Our plan begins with night's fall.
I shall go stand watch elsewhere. You head that way, goodfisher.
Then take it. I am eager to be rid of this rat -- if we can improve the snare, let us do so.
'Tis time. I've faith in you, cousin.
And why not? As Arisen, petty thieves are a simple quarry, aye?
Thieving rat!
Don't let him go!
There! He flees!
Waugh!
Catch him!
Stay calm, cousin!
Almost there.
Aye, you've caught him!
That was fine work last night, goodfisher.
What's more, the rat you caught has a loose tongue. He spoke of the company he keeps.
A band of thieves that style themselves "the Iron Hammer." They've taken a stronghold in the south for their home.
Seems they eat well on the goods they pinch from merchants walking the nearby roads.
If you've cause to head south, pray, keep watch for their ilk.
The rat slipped away again...
'Tis back to the start. We shall have him in time, cousin.
You had him nearly at hand, goodfisher. Damn shame he slipped away.
Pray, do not let it trouble you. We shall persist until the rat is caught!
I leave capturing the felon to you. ...I've not the courage for such a task.
The plan hinges upon you, cousin. We've faith in you.
Now, as ever, your aid is needed to ward the village from crime, cousin.
Hear him out
Not now
I am eager to be rid of this thief for good and all, cos. Will you lend a hand once more?
Accept
Not now
Oy, what are you doing? The plan's for naught if you leave your post, cos.
Do be serious this time, aye?
Forget this place, cos. Go and catch the blackguard!
Augh!
You...you seem the type unlike to judge a man by his mien alone.
I would ask you a favor, ser, if it please you?
Hear him out
Not now
As you will... No matter. Pray, enjoy your weary, lusterless life.
A wise choice. I warrant you'll be eager to hear what I've to say.
I have long searched for a certain tome...
Salomet's Grimoire. 'Tis said its pages hold the power to grant the reader command of grand arcane magicks.
The book itself is ensorceled, you see. Even a novice is as a grand wizard with that grimoire in hand.
I would ask you to seek it out and bring it to me, ser.
Recompense? Pray, let us speak of such things once you've found the book.
Unwanted possessions and other refuse ultimately find their way here.
I'd hoped perhaps to find the book here, but... 'Twas a vain hope, it seems.
Salomet was a scholar. The leader of a council of sorcerers. He was a genius... A luminary.
Until the day he went mad. He put the fruits of the council's research to the flame and disappeared.
Aye, geniuses are so oft touched with madness...<cf>But enough of him.
I care only about the tome he kept with him in his research.
I would make it mine, ser. Even if it means sifting through the muck to find it.
So it was stolen, then...
No, no. 'Tis good news. This saves me from dredging the river in vain.
You're quite the wonder to have learned so much so quickly, ser.
Yes, this is it! At long last, Salomet's grimoire is mine!
It wears a humble look, but there's an aura of such power about it... 'Tis a wonder.
My thanks, ser. Truly, I must do aught to repay this kindness.
In the future, should we meet again!
Yes, this is it! At long last, Salomet's grimoire is mine!
Though... 'Tis strange. It bears the look of Salomet's tome, but aught feels different. ...My imagining, no doubt.
My thanks, ser. Truly, I must do aught to repay this kindness.
In the future, should we meet again!
To bring about the end...and with it,<cf>a new beginning.
When the creator falls, so falls all<cf>creation.
There is but one way to slay a god...
The Godsbane blade... Its edge alone<cf>can free you of your office.
If there is aught capable of offering<cf>death's release, it must be...
This truly is a place without end...
How long will this world continue?
Tis endless, this world. Truly<cf>infinite...
Create, destroy... Advance, return...<cf>'Tis all the same, now.
The Seneschal is dead...yet the world<cf>continues.
The world is yours, now... In every<cf>sense.
A new god is born. 'Tis you, Arisen.
Then you are now Seneschal, steward<cf>over all creation...
With every beginning, comes an end...
Master... It's time this journey came<cf>to an end.
Then our work is done... Our quest is<cf>won, Master.
'Tis no small thing, to author an end<cf>to our tale...
Speak your will, Master.
How do you fare, Master?
If it is the end you desire, 'twill<cf>require an iron will.
Herbs?
Ah, for brewing ale...
Very well. Here, you are welcome to these.
...More herbs?
Aye, If you wish. Here you are...

Aaaugh!
Make haste!
My tools... Rrgh!
There's no doubt, then. Quina is gone to<cf>the Witchwood.
Seems Quina's gone to the Witchwood.
Shall we go after her then?
Why would the Faith seek to learn of<cf>Wyrmspeak?
Chief Adaro will be worrying.<cf>Let's return and put his mind to ease.
That girl... She had the feel of... No.<cf>Pray, forget I mentioned it.
The fog is thick... Take care not to lose<cf>your way.
This is no natural fog, Arisen.
I feel magick within this mist...
Is this the right path...?
I well know the Witchwood, Arisen.<cf>Follow me.
Take care we're not separated from Quina.
Let us hasten back to the wood.
If she is not in the village, perhaps at<cf>the shore, or in the woods?
This road leads to the Witchwood.
We'll pass the encampment. This way!
The Witchwood is this way, though 'tis a<cf>fair walk yet.
Follow this road down and we'll come to<cf>the Witchwood.
This path leads left.
There, just ahead, Master. A woman.
Is... Is that Quina?
We make for the area across this river and<cf>beyond.
Let's head this way.
Tis a strange place, this. Is this what<cf>we seek?
It seems we've arrived.
To judge from the name, the Witchwood<cf>seems a frightening place.
The Witchwood is some leagues off,<cf>but I should be glad to guide you.
Hold, Arisen. Do we not make for the<cf>wood?
Keep away, lest I relieve you of your teeth!
...
What?
Can't you see you're not wanted here?
You're in the way, outsider.
Your high-and-mighty act won't work on us.
I can see you trembling...
Get out of here.
I like your spirit, ser.
You're almost worthy to be one of us.

A grimoire? Salomet, was it? Nay, I've not heard of it.
But other rats have been scurrying about after such trinkets, I hear.
The Iron Hammer, I mean. Pack of filthy thieves stinking up the south of Gransys.
Their leader's the worst of the lot. Fancies himself a regular scholar, all learned-like. Bah!
Probably him what wanted grimoires collected up. Though, talk is, half of those things are forgeries anyway...
The Stone of the North? Aye, there's tell Lord Julien rode for there not long ago.
I don't ken the cause of the uproar, but I'll warrant the matter's well in hand.
By all accounts, he's as skilled a diplomat as a warrior. Equal parts fox and lion, that one.
(No current quests)
Even the roads are overrun...
Welcome, ser, though I fear this place affords little hospitality.
How do you find playing the role of Arisen, ser? Ah, but I misspeak. 'Tis far from play, I know.
I meant only the role of hero must be tiresome work. To meet the demands for ceaseless feats of valor...
I may have one such task to offer, if you've the time and inclination. ...Well, ser?
Hear him out
Not now
Then pray, allow me to begin with a word about this<cf>stronghold...
Given the hold's remote location, those who man it are oft required to remain here for long stretches of time.
And sadly, the worsening dangers that plague the roads have kept all freight from reaching us.
No matter the number of pleas I send to the capital, I receive no response.
We're to commence a new regimen of training soon, but morale among the men is dismal.
By now, we are a week's food and arms in arrears. Our remaining stores will not last long.
It would be a mercy if you, as Arisen, would go and speak to the court on our behalf...
...And in so doing, earn acclaim for precluding a dire crisis in the duchy's defense.
In Gran Soren, you will find a Lord Julien. The hold's expeditions and supply fall under his charge.
Pray, speak with him, else the other guards within the duke's castle.
'Twas an idle worry, then! You've confidence your feats present an Arisen fit to meet all expectation.
I shall not press the matter further. Pray, continue in your efforts, ser!
Oh? Will you hear my proposal then, ser? 'Tis a fine opportunity, if I may say.
Hear him out
Not now
Pray, make for the duke's castle and see that Lord Julien hears of our supply woes.
If he cannot be found, any of the men of the castle will suffice. We need a week's food and arms, ser.
His Grace will be glad of the report, and you shall be the one to claim credit.
I see you delivered the message safely to the capital, ser. My thanks.
Left the message to a guard, did you? Well, no matter. It appears to have reached Lord Julien just the same.
Again, my thanks for making the journey, ser. Neither I nor the other men of the Stone shall soon forget this kindness.
I see you delivered the message safely to the capital, ser. My thanks.
There appears to have been some...confusion of the request, but precision oft falls victim to urgency.
It was good of you to make the journey.
I see you delivered the message safely to the capital, ser.
And to Lord Julien himself... My thanks.
What? Two days' supply more than my request? Two days... Yes, I see...
You've done us a great service, Arisen. I am certain your efforts will bear fruit... I promise it, in fact.
My thanks for your trouble, ser.
...Mm? A message from Lord Julien?
Two additional days, is it? ...Yes, I see.
You've done well, good Arisen. Your efforts shall not be in vain.<cf>...I guarantee it.
Something further, ser...? A meal from the Lord's own larder, is it? My, my!
The men will be delighted, I'm sure. You are kind to have gone to the trouble.
I am called Castor. Ser Daerio has informed me of my duties.
I am thankful to have you accompanying me to the capital. Shall we be off?
Yes
Not yet
Very well, ser.
As you wish, ser. I shall await you here.
Well, ser? Are you prepared for the journey to Gran Soren?
Ser Daerio bade me speak on Fournival's behalf. I would welcome your escort there.
Yes
Not yet
Ser Daerio met with a messenger not long ago. It seems he has aught to discuss with you, ser.
Let us make for the capital.
Keep vigilant for monsters, ser.
Wouldn't do to die afore offering my testimony.
Are you all right?
Take care, ser -- my life is in your hands.
I'm bled...deep...
Have you some business here?
I am called Mirabelle, ser.
Lady in waiting to my mistress, Aelinore, newly come to this place as His Grace's bride. A duchess now, she is.
'Tis a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Arisen.
My mistr...er, the Duchess and I are come from Meloire, north in Auldring.
Come all this way to a foreign land to wed. Mistress Aelinore, that is, not I. I never did marry.
But yes, freshly come as a bride and the dragon attacks! 'Tis ill<cf>fortune to beat all, oui?
My...the Duchess ne'er was blessed with good fortune. Even as a child.
I say the child needs learn speak her mind more frankly, if I may be so bold as to say.
Always too gentle, that one. Too eager to please. And she's e'er been left holding the short straw for it.
Even the business of this present marriage. Oui, Duke Edmun is<cf>the hero that slayed the dragon in his day...
But his day is long past, if you'll forgive me saying, and he hardly has a face to swoon for...
Oh, but my tongue runs loose!
You've a commoner's mien, Arisen, that I fear has got me to gossiping like an old hen.
Silence is golden, so the saying goes. I shall still my mouth awhile.
It pains me to burden you, busy as you are with the Royal Orders, but there is aught I would speak of with you.
'Tis a cause of worry, though I speak only for myself and not as chamberlain. Might I beg a moment?
Hear him out
Not now
Skeletons have been sighted near the capital these past few days.
Elsewhere, I've had no end of reports of secret meetings among the zealots of Salvation.
I cannot help but see the two as intertwined, though I have no evidence to prove it.
Still, I'll be damned if I allow their kind to go corrupting the minds of good people for want of evidence.
Arisen, I ask this as a favor... Will you look into these events and hunt out any thread that connects them?
I believe I've learned where the cult meets -- I've made note of it on your map.
I ask you begin your search there. Go, and learn what you can.
Salvation stirs in the shadows, Arisen. I hope I am wrong to pay them such concern...
Just the same, it would weigh less on me if I might share my worry with you.
Hear him out
Not now
I... I see. You've important matters of your own. I had doubted whether I ought mention it at all...
Yet still, it gnaws at me. My instinct says that to ignore it is to invite calamity...
I've detailed our nearest estimate of their meeting place upon your map.
Above all, see that you are not discovered in your search. Quiet as a shadow, Arisen...
Then you've had it from their own mouths... I see.
I knew Salvation had aught to do with those skeletons. I knew it!
We cannot allow this to stand. For now, we need gather more information... You have my thanks, Arisen.
The catacombs are cleansed of rats thanks to your efforts, Arisen.
The roads, too, are all but free from the skeleton warriors. Gransys is safe for the moment.
Documents they left behind shed some light on Salvation's actions as of late.
It seems the skeletons were an attempt to bolster their numbers. A thought I do not relish...
What's more, it was their own member's bones they put to use -- newly joined believers made living sacrifices.
They were turned from flesh to living bone by some dark art, all as a part of some experiment.
The writings claim that bone warriors wrought from living men are stronger than those come from corpses...
Even for a cult of madmen, to visit such atrocities upon their own... 'Tis a horror.
And one now hopefully at an end. Again, you have my thanks, Arisen. Pray, accept this small token for your efforts.
The witch? Aye, you cannot help but hear the stories of late...
They say she was friendly with the people of Cassardis, once...
But after the Faith erected a church, the villagers named her heretic and drove her hence.
That is why she summoned the dragon, they say -- as revenge for the insult...
Give chase, men!
The swarm of goblins must be stopped.
Maker knows how goblins overran the very fort built to contain them.
I pray the goblins won't find the Stone's ballista.
'Tis a fearsome age when even the Stone of the Southwest falls.
After this, I'll surely not balk at sentry work again.
Men are stretched thin across the duchy. We'll not get any aid.
Retreaaat!
Pull back! Baaack!
We're ordered to turn back!
Run!
Raaaaaaaauuugh!
Ah!
Eyah!
Aaaaah...
Ha!
Haah!
Hello.
Goodbye.
Yes.
No.
Thank you.
Thank you, ser, truly!
Well?
Go ahead, look as you like.
Ooh, a fine choice.
Oh, good!
You'll come again, won't you?
That's a cruel joke...
Hmm, what d'you say to this?
For me, eh?
Here you are.
All right.
Not a chance!
Aye, what?
Do not hound me so!
The realm's in a right state, eh?
No one knows what tomorrow may bring.
These days, you've got to watch out for yourself.
Know of a way a girl can earn some quick coin?
What will remain for us when the wyrm is done?
'Tis enough to give one nightmares...
I half thought the wyrm was upon us.
This isn't... This can't be real...
Well?
Thank you, ser, truly!
They're gathered above, ser. Engaged in some dark ritual, from the look of it.
It makes my skin crawl just to think on it... Who can say what they aim to do?
I'll open the rear door for you. Go, and Maker be your shield!
The beast comes! Hurry!
You acquired a stone tablet.
Much of the ancient writing upon it is undecipherable.
Only a handful of words are clear: "dragon," "Arisen," and "church"...
Hail, brother.
Naught to report?
Who is that!?
An impostor!
Hmm, perhaps if I'm quick... But then, I've never been the fortunate sort...
And I cannot rightly leave them here awhiles...
Ask what the matter is
Leave her for now
Ah, you've come at a grand time. Hear me a moment, cousin.
You know I've always been a fair hand at mixing medicines, and now the dragon's left a fair number wounded in its wake, I've been helping tend to them.
Trouble is, my store of herbs is all but spent. Still, Maker only knows what lurks in the woods...
I cannot risk injury when so many depend upon my aid. Will you fetch some flowers in my stead?
They bloom at the roots of full-grown trees. Like as not there are some right here in the village, though I know not how many.
Able hands are in short supply, cousin. We as can work must do what we can. Bring any flowers you find here.
I'd craft dressings for the wounded, had I the makings. If only I'd known...
Cos, I need a favor. Can you fetch the flowers I need from outside the village?
I need more of the one you see there, and one other sort besides.
The more you can find, the better.
It grieves me to leave the wounded to suffer so...
The injured yet suffer. If they're not treated soon... 
Make haste with those flowers, would you? There ought to be some in the village. Search among the grasses and at the base of trees.
Aye, that's the one! The sap of that flower makes a fine poultice. My thanks for fetching it.
Still, there are more injured than this will treat. I'll need more than a single bloom.
And Moonglow to complete the compound, what's more. 'Tis an unusual flower, and not easily found just now.
Alas, I've the wounded to tend to and little time to speak. Pray, ask the others of the village.
You've other things to do yourself, no doubt, but 'tis for a good cause. Lives hang in the balance.
You'll not leave the task half-done, aye? Good. I leave the matter in your hands.
Aye, that's the one. Now I need the other, cos.
We've no time to waste. Pray, hurry.
The wounded need medicine, cousin. Pray, bring the flowers for the compound, quick as you can.
The mixture calls for two types of flowers. Speak to the others for more word on that.
I ask you this favor because I trust you, goodfisher. I know you'll not leave these people to suffer.
Ah, brought the rest of them, have you? My thanks, cousin.
All that remains is to find some Moonglow. A pinch mixed with these will make a fine medicine.
Aye, that's the one! You've found it!
Moonglow has grown rare in these parts of late. 'Tis a relief to see it.
Good, that's the both of them. In truth, I am surprised to see them got so quickly.
I'll get to work directly. With luck, we'll have everyone back to health ere long. 'Tis your doing, cousin.
I fear there's little I can offer you in thanks, save this. Pray, take it. Now to make some medicine!
Thanks to you, those wounded by the dragon are well and healed.
As much as any medicine, it was the sight of you fighting for the village's sake what healed them, if you ask me.
If there's ever aught I can do to help, just say it, cousin.
Found them all at last, have you? I am sorry for the trouble, cousin.
I only hope we're not too late. I shall do my best...
I'm no doctor. I fear there's precious little I can do for them, but better little than naught at all, aye?
No more have died, at least. We must be thankful for that.
But it will take time yet afore life in Cassardis is as it was before. Fear still grips the village...
No man can hasten the tide, I suppose.
Oh, 'tis you, cousin...
I did all I could for them, but still I... I could not save them all. The treatment came too late.
I ought never have allowed my stores to fall so low. Had I those buds before the attack, I...
'Tis a resolution come too late, I know. My regrets will not raise the dead...
Let this work...
Turn out your pockets, and be quick about it!
I-I haven't spoken a word! Not a word, I swear it! You must believe me!
I'd no idea that was the Arisen! How could I have!? Please!
We've already men scouring the Witchwood.
Myself, I have doubts the old crone holds sway over the dragon...
But in dark times, we can ill afford risk. Dangerous types the likes of her must be brought to heel.

Maul spoke of me...?
Then they know me for a traitor... Aye, I'd little doubt they would.
Maul took me in as a boy. Said he saw promise in me...
And here I've given him naught for all he's done. Just up and left. Left thieving, now, too.
You're the Arisen, ser. Mayhap you would know best. What ought I do?
Return to Maul's hold and offer up your life.
Leave the village and run far away.
Nothing at all.
...Aye. I fear you have the right of it. 'Tis the proper thing to do.
I cannot run from the oaths I've sworn.
I shall return, as you say.
Like as not, I shall walk to my death, but at least I shall die a man.
I thank you, ser... Farewell.
I see... 'Tis a sensible course of action.
If Maul has not forgiven me, he's like to send his men... It would not do to have others here harmed.
I shall consider your words, ser...
Hmm, I am sorely tempted, but...are you certain it is wise?
I still cannot decide... Is it right that I remain here?
No matter how long I think of it, I come to no answer. What do you consider best?
Return to Maul's hold and offer up your life.
Leave the village and run far away.
Nothing at all.
I mustered what mettle I have and came back ready to die...and was pardoned!
Next I fail, my head will fly, make no mistake of that. ...But this is the path I chose for myself. I've no regrets.
Arisen...<cf>You have earned back what is yours!
Spread out and search!
Now, choose. Stand against me, or speak your<cf>wish.
Offer your beloved in forfeit, and I shall see your<cf>will done.
Choose? How am I to choose?
No matter my answer, the price is death.
A hollow choice... Who am I to stand as<cf>arbiter of two lives?
...Of two loves.
What would you have me do?
You brought me here. You...
If this be the will of the gods... The order<cf>of the world... Then damn the lot of them!
No matter my answer... A hollow choice... Who am I to...<cf>What would you... If this be the will of the gods...
I'll tear the whole of it asunder!
Very well... If that be your wish, I shall claim my<cf>price.
Stop! NOOOOOO!
Aaaaaaugh!
Make haste. This place drives even the<cf>stoutest of minds to lunacy.
Heed these words, all who enter this place.
Do not think. Just set one foot in front of the other and by the Maker's love, keep swinging.
None of it matters, now... None of it... Pray,<cf>leave me to sleep in peace.
I feel it in the marrow of my bones... Some<cf>force beckons me beyond.
I will make for it, though my body fail along the way...
Let's have that gate open!
There's some trick to opening this<cf>gate... Hmm...
Let's end our ogre problem once<cf>and for all!
The monsters await, Arisen.
The ogre lair is this way.<cf>Are you prepared, Master?
No ogre...<cf>Stay vigilant, Master.
Seems the duration the gate stays<cf>open varies with weight...
We might avoid them had we some<cf>diversion...
A corpse might serve as ogre bait.
To bait an ogre, use meat, or a corpse.<cf>Alternately, a woman ought suffice.
There was a side path here somewhere...
We must circle around to the far side<cf>to open the gate.
The gate is open!
'Tis the last of them.
Seems that was the last ogre in the<cf>quarry.
Now this place can see use once<cf>again.
The path stands clear.
Let's return in time.
What will they carve from the quarry's<cf>walls? A thrilling thought.
Is this the gate, then? Seems it'll not<cf>open for us easily.
The floor... It seems there's some<cf>mechanism, Arisen.
The panel, Arisen! It responds to weight.
Hmm... Perhaps some device will<cf>open it.
A bit of bait may earn us a reprieve<cf>from combat.
It won't open. Perhaps it requires<cf>a key?
Careful, Master!
This place is a nest of fiends.
Stay cautious.
'Tis closed and bolted tight...
We've done it!

I come from hearty stock. My body is quick to recover, and my mind always ready to adapt, come what may.
I thank the Maker for my gifts in times such as these -- village needing rebuildin' and all.
Suppose the first order is a new pier what can withstand a dragon attack or two, eh?
Fortune has chosen a strange path for us. 
Did we sin? Did we anger the Maker? Can't help but ask such questions, times as these...
I'll manage well enough. Pray, see to the others.
Arisen... Forgive me.
All I've done was to test your will.
It is the fate of all Arisen...
You and I are swept up in the current, same as the rest.
Each tempers the volition of the next,
and the endless cycle continues.
And so, until the coming of a new soul<cf>fit to craft the will to live--
Someone like you.
Until that day, may you guide the world ever justly.
I present you with the Godsbane blade...
Those who arise to oversee this world are undying,
save by this brand's kiss.
I ask that you, as the world's new seneschal,
use it now to vouchsafe freedom to your weary servant.
Those pawns you're traveling with? Ah, an Arisen, then.
There's a guild in the city where them pawns gather.
Might be you'll find some use of it.
Like as not, arrangements for your audience with His Grace will take some time. Go rest for now.
Been formally acknowledged by His Grace, have you? Then you'll have your run of the land.
Needless travel's barred for most folk without the Duke's dispensation.
You being the Arisen though, serve the duchy's interest as a member of the Hunt.
You'll be free to go wherever your search for the wyrm takes you.
I hear you're taking orders direct from Duke Edmun himself.
You're free to come here any time the duke's business demands.
Go on then, you're free to pass.
My post prevents me from idle chatter.
...But I've heard tell of your feats, ser! And what stories they were!
If you've business inside, you're free to pass.
Might be it's not proper for a man in my position to say so...
But the lot of us couldn't hold this place a day, should the dragon strike.
It's a mercy to know you're out there fighting for us, ser.
You've slain the beast, ser!? What manner of omen is this darkened sky, then?
Well, suppose that can wait. For now, pray, enter. The duke awaits.
The gates close at sundown. If you've business past here, it will have to wait till morning.
There's no entrance at night. Come back when the sun is up.
Pray, forgive me, ser, but I'm under orders to keep the gates closed till dawn breaks.
I am sorry, ser. I'll have her open at first light.
I'd a feeling you might be our escort.
Aye, we are the company of "elites" you're to march with. A poor jest, I know.
We'll circle the capital, striking the griffin as we come upon it along the way.
We attack when it sets down. 'Tis nothing so clever as to be called a stratagem, but it will work.
If you still care to join us after hearing all that, let's be off.
Be sure to carry your weight.
Focus. The hunt is afoot.
Clear your mind of all but the fight!
Do not let down your guard!
It comes!
Now! Everyone!
Make haste!
What are you doing!?
Bastard!
Rngh...
Rrragh!
Aaaugh!
Leave me! Go!
Hold the line!
Damnable bird!
Waaaaugh!
The way is blocked! Double back!
Enough! Fall back!
The beast has us bloodied, but not broken.
Keep your wits about you, men. I'll see no more good men die today!
This way, Arisen!
You're not safe there. Stop loafing about!
Shit... No falling back now.
Path is lost. Nowhere left but onward, men!
Don't stop! We're exposed here!
What are you doing!? Onward! Go!
The beast comes! Run!
Behind us! Stand clear!
If you want aught done right...
I'll hold the beast here! You lot press on! Go!
You tend to your own concerns.
The gate is near fallen! Help me!
Rrgh... What fool thought to seal this place so tightly? We must break through!
We've made it through... Come, we'll slay it from the rooftop!
Good to see you still drawing breath, friend.
It seems I, too, was lucky.
'Tis a shame it can be said of so few...
Damned bird, fleeing to its roost the moment its fortunes turn...
We cannot let this chance escape. Come, Arisen. To the Bluemoon Tower!
I wish you all success, Arisen.
The duke has seemed different of late.
In fact, the mood of the whole castle seems diffrent than in days of auld.
Life must weigh heavy on the mind of His Grace, especially at a time like this.
Do mind yourself around him.
Past this point's a nest for the city's poorest.
There's many a rat holed up among the honest folk. Guard your purse, friend.
Some lot calls itself "Salvation" was sneaking about the slums of late.
Like as not, they were sowing the seeds of revolt. Just see if I'm wrong.
Wickedness grows in shadow, sure enough, and these dark times cast long shadows indeed.
You take orders direct from the duke, don't you?
Surely there's naught brings someone like that to a slum like this?
I got a feeling the dragon's almost upon us, I do...
The sad lot living in these slums has got nowhere to run to. And no coin to get there, besides.
All they can do now is pray. Not that I'm any better off, mind.
Seems we were spared the dragon, but ruin's found the city just the same...
Maker be good, what's to happen to us next?
There but by the Maker's grace, eh?
Merciful Maker...

My master was ever collecting bits of some thing...
They now reside in the keeping of the pawns here...
You owe the Arisen a debt of thanks, woman...
Your she-goat's pride is lost, but you've kept your head.
Thank you, ser, truly!
An inquest, eh? Cheers! I welcome the diversion.
I know 'tis improper to say so, but you'll not deny the thrill of awaiting a judgment.
Though it's the rare trial that's not decided afore it begins, if truth be told.
Proofs are easily falsified. Testimony still more so...
There's always someone with cause to want one outcome or the other, and the means to ensure it.
Which brings me to a very special deal for you, friend.
Writs of affidavit, for sale at bargain rates! I've statements averring guilt or innocence.
Quite the clever forgeries, these. They always sell well when there's an inquest on.
And why not? 'Tis a heady thing, to buy a man's guilt or innocence.
If you've a stake in the trial's result, you'd be a fool not to.
I'll disavow we ever spoke if asked, mind. The choice is yours to make.

Who goes there!?
Where d'you think you're going?
Halt!
You'll go no farther!
M-my deepest apologies...
What brings you here, ser?
I cannot allow even the Arisen to pass unbidden.
I would thank you to refrain from such actions in the future, ser...
I knew you for a villain!
I've suffered your avarice and deceptions out of deference to the office of Arisen...
But you have shown your true color, ser! You are a traitor to the duke and to us all!
Put this rogue to chains, men! His Grace commands the Arisen's capture, dead or alive!
Arisen... Ser, how could you!?
I cannot think you entirely innocent of what has happened, nor do I doubt His Grace's words...
Yet... I also cannot think you an enemy to the people of Gransys.
Alas, I am duty-bound to follow what orders I am given, ser. Pray, forgive me.
His Grace commands the Arisen's capture, men!
Ah!
Aiee!
Aaaaugh...
Yoh...
Hrrnagh!
I trust the day finds you well, ser?
I take my leave of you, ser.
You are correct, ser.
I fear that's not so, ser.
My, what an honor.
I fear I'm scarce fit to accept such generosity, ser.
Are you a warrior come to help His Grace then, ser?
The duke's a good man, but so stern. I hope his stony manner's given you no offense.
He's a hero, to be sure, but there are days I fear his frown worse than any dragonfire, I do.
It's a mystery what that man's thinking, least to me. Good days and bad, he wears that frown...
And I hear he's barely spoke a word to that new pretty young wife of his, the poor dear...
My old mum worked here in the castle, too, since afore I was born.
To hear it from her, Duke Edmun was a dour man even then.
It was a terrible thing happened to His Grace's last wife, to pass<cf>so young...
But she might have left him an heir, at least, had he not been so aloof.
Yes, yes, so the dragon's coming...
I don't see what wailing and gnashing our teeth will help.
I told the other girls there's still washing to be done -- the duke can't fight naked, can he?
I fear I'm scarce fit to accept such generosity, ser.
Which way should we go, Arisen?
The leftward path bears the stink<cf>of death...
I hear running water from the right.
This bridge is too far decayed to use.
The water below looks shallow<cf>enough to ford...
Is there no way down?
We've nowhere to go but up...
We'll have to jump our way across.
An animal carcass...
Seems its been dead for some time.
'Twas the victim of a monster, most<cf>like.
We'd best take care not to meet the<cf>same end.
If we're to proceed, we've no<cf>choice but to jump...
Look, there are footholds... We<cf>ought to be able to return this way.
'Tis unusually vast for a well...
The way is fully blocked.
The boulder is gone.
Light pours in from aboveground.
...Looks as if we've come to a dead end.
It must be bolted from the far side.
There's naught we can do from here.
Keep the lantern dry!
A message for Lord Julien? Aye, I'll gladly relay it if you wish, ser.
A dearth in supplies at the Stone of the North? Food and arms, in chief... I see.
Was there word of how much they need, ser?
One week's supply.
Enough for training exercises.
'Twas left to his discretion.
Understood, ser.
I shall see Lord Julien receives your message without fail. I thank you for relaying it.
Worried, ser? You've my word, your message will reach Lord Julien.
Pray, give my regards to the men of the Stone.
I am he who strides the sky. Your cowardice shall be exposed.
We don't deal in the like of grimoires here.
We're an honest business. Those magick tomes are oft forgeries, else stolen property.
Hoy, there's a notion. Why not ask a thief?
They're more like to have it than honest folk like me, I'll<cf>warrant you.

Ah!
Wha!
Aaargh...
Ngh!
Hngh!
Feeling alright?
Pray, be careful.
Mm-hmm.
Gracious, no.
Thanks to you.
Oh my! You have my thanks!
Everyone's to gather at the chief's house. Even my husband plans to speak.
Though 'less a tree needs rootin' or a boulder broke, he's of little use I fear.
Merin was at sea when the dragon struck his fearsome blow. 
I daresay he's ashamed of that, somehow. As if being here might have tacked fate's course in a new direction...
But had he been home, I'd be a widow -- all the better he was away.
Such thoughts are vanity what with others suffering so, but I find I cannot help it.
Ah, it's you!
The one what stood against the dragon when he set on the<cf>village...
I hear fearsome tell of your wounds. Is there aught I can do for you?
It was Quina's prayers what saved you from death. I'm sure of it.
It's a rare day one sees a prayer answered so surely, eh?
Our chief suffers in these times. That there was some way to help him...
They say when a dragon appears, it portends doom on all surrounding lands.
I know of villages that packed all and struck out for safer waters after an attack.
I'll only flee if the chief demands it.
So you're the Arisen, eh? I imagine you'll be off on a magickal quest soon.
You will be coming back, I trust? This is your home, after all.
We know you've duties throughout the land, so there's no shame in your leaving.
Besides, it'll take more than a dragon to scare this village away!
Welcome back, welcome home. I hear tell you've been off to the capital, then?
They say the duke raises an army to challenge the dragon?
His Grace defeated a dragon once, you know? Wrung the beast's neck with his own two hands, or so I've heard!
Quite the traveler you've become.
My husband is jealous. He keeps spouting foolishness about aiding your battle against the dragon. 
See you don't forget them who helped raise you, now.
A task from Duke Edmun himself? M-my goodness! I'm flushed just to think of it!
Mind you don't push yourself past breaking, all right?
You've always a home here to rest your head. Even the strongest net needs mending, time to time.
Days are slow here... Time passes like a river in the chill of winter.
Some days I wonder if the dragon came at all. It oft feels like a fevered dream...
But then I see you and know the dragon yet lives, his strength growing with each passing day.
Course I fear the dragon! Only a fool thick as my husband would maintain otherwise.
Aye, Merin claims to fear not the dragon, but I know better. 
The sight of those wings and even the stoutest turn craven.
They say Quina has been taken!? Is it true?
By the Maker... Will evil never leave us at peace?
Some days the fear grips me so tight, I can scarce leave my home.
It's strange... I've held fast to hope since first the dragon appeared...
But I find I lost my grasp. I can no longer pretend to happiness.
The dragon has made his move, it would seem...
Maker and all his powers defend us.
My husband cloaks his fear in boastful talk, but I know better.
And yet, I do not blame him. Only a fool wouldn't be afraid.
I'm no fool...yet somehow, there are times the wild idea we might survive finds me.
We must hold faith that victory is possible. You are proof of that much, Arisen!
We must hold faith that victory is possible. You are proof of that much, Arisen!
I've naught to say but thanks. Yet the word seems frail in the face of all you've endured.
When first the dragon came, I was sure none could challenge it and live.
But you have proven that certainty false.
The wyrm scattered scores of men like matchsticks...
Yet a humble fisher stood against it.
You are a hero true, as if come alive from songs of old.
Welcome home, hero. 
I know you pursue aspirations beyond my reckoning, but I pray you return to us when all is well and finished.
Though you be hero to all the lands, none can name you family save us.
You've always a home here to rest your head. Even the strongest net needs mending, time to time.
Oh my! You have my thanks!

My, my...
Didn't know if you'd have the stomach<cf>to do for an unarmed man.
'Spose I was wrong to doubt it.
Glad to know you're someone I can trust<cf>in times to come.
And come they shall...
I'll send word ere long, friend.
We'll bring this skulk of foxes to bay, you and I.
Ngh.
Hnngh...
Gagh...
Mh!
Mnnh!
Well met...
Very well...
Mm.
No.
I accept it gladly.
My thanks...
As you've like come to know, this pawn served the Dragonforged in his journeys as the Arisen.
The path we walked to the dragon's door saw its end long ago...
So long ago, 'tis lost to the haze of oblivion now.
Did we truly walk this world? Or was it but a dream glimpsed from beyond the rift?
I cannot say even that much, so long ago it was...
The Dragonforged suffered mortal injury in combat with the wyrm, though he persists now between life and death.
And so he waits for Arisen to come, that he may bequeath his knowledge unto them.
In the fullness of time, I shall come to know when the time has come.
Know that all I know is that I shall know all who know me.
I am not but my shadow, though my shadow be not shadow, but myself.
I am come here at the end of my journeys, rich in scars and rich of mind.
I am dragon-forged, knower of the beast and known to it in kind.
There have been other Arisen come before you to meet my master...
Two, perhaps. Or three...
Even when the dragon descends upon the land, the Arisen may never come to find this place.
In truth, the Arisen is not bound to join the dragon in combat, should they not will it.
While the dragon lives, so lives each stolen heart...
The Arisen has time unending to decide how to spend time unending.
I had a different look the day my master pulled me from the rift.
But o'er the ages I have spent together with the Dragonforged, change has taken me.
His thoughts have come to fill my head, his feelings my breast.
In time, even my form has grown to mirror his.
'Tis said that pawns are the shadows of men.
The shadow cast by a flame flickers and bends, even as it takes a steady form...
Just so, it may be that we pawns come to take the forms of our masters.
My master chose to follow the bidding of his inner voice.
He cast aside all ties to others and chose to stand against the dragon.
These ages on, I feel I understand why he did so.
The Dragonforged trusted in himself too much.
...Rather, he trusted none but himself. In me no more than in any other.
In the fullness of time, I shall come to know when the time has come.
Know that all I know is that I shall know all who know me.
I am not but my shadow, though my shadow be not shadow, but myself.
I am come here at the end of my journeys, rich in scars and rich of mind.
I am dragon-forged, knower of the beast and known to it in kind.
My thanks...
If there's talk of a sorcerer, it'll be Salomet, no doubt.
I'd hoped we were rid of that rat for good. I do not relish thought of his return.
But the pilfered ring does bear a strong magickal affinity... 'Tis the sort of bauble Salomet would covet.
A strange trick of fate...to meet a fellow countryman.
So be it. Mayhap there is a new truth to be found in dragon's form...
'Tis the will of the world... Stand against me!
Graugh...! Yes!
The world calls out for a new ringmaster...
...Earth and man and monster all.
All are equal parts within the whole.
Fall into disorder.
Gather, raging flame!
Come, gath'ring storm!
Forget all you once knew!
The light of destruction!
Which shall you be...?
Man? Dragon? Or aught else?
A shame, my countryman.
Uh.
Uugh.
Gnaaaaugh...
Hah!
Haaah!
Hmph. Still alive, are you?
Don't die.
Aye.
No.
My thanks.
Mm... That merits a proper thanks.
Now here's a curious mark, come to the thieves' den of his own accord.
I've no dislike of curious things...
Though in snakes and spiders both, 'tis the curious ones bear the fiercest venom.
We've fresh meat, boys.
A strange one, this, but a mark's a mark. Strip 'em, boys!
A little bird tells me you're Arisen, then.
I'd known you for a strange sort, but the Arisen...
Well, it's little matter to me. The daftest thief knows well better than to choose the strange ones for a mark.
The Arisen is an interesting creature indeed.
You act on behalf of justice, even when it strays from the law... You are driven by more than the promise of profit...
I would be curious to follow your exploits, even were your actions not tied so to Gransys' fate.
How fares the Arisening business?
Not a moment's rest for the likes of us, aye?
I've no love of lagabouts.
Leave my sight.
You're in the way. Piss off.
You're welcome as the bleeding flux.
What are you doing?
I've no time for your chatter.
I will be frank: I care not.
You again, is it?
Seems we've finally come up against the end of the world, aye?
Well, a thief's like to hang on any given day...
To live to see the very end's a luxury indeed.
Little use, with the world at an end...but let's rob the fool anyway!
Mm... That merits a proper thanks.

My warrior has come for me!
...You must think me a shameless harlot.
Would that words could prove my love is pure!
Off to a night's siring after a long day's ruling, sire?
No...! You must hide!
There is the boldness that felled a dragon!
Here! Quickly!
You storm milady's bedchambers<cf>with the urgency of a man in battle!
Fear not, I shan't eavesdrop on the<cf>ducal proceedings.
I remain to stand watch--guard! ...Sire.
For your protection, of course.
My Lord Edmun...
Would you had mentioned your coming,
I might have dressed more finely...
Milord...? What are you...
...Lenore...
Lenore... Oh, my love!
Forgive me!
Milord... Edmun. Is something the--
Lenore, forgive me... I was wrong!
I take it back, Lenore!
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
LENORE!
Well met, Arisen. Can you hear our voice?
'Tis times such as these you earn your keep, Arisen! Don't run, face the beast!
I cannot allow you through.
A messenger brought word of Fournival's trial.
More's the pity. He furnished our arms at quite the favorable rate.
We'll be as cats without claws should he be kept from doing business.
I do not know the man well, but I cannot stand idly by and see him convicted.
Testimony given in person will carry more weight than a missive, yet I cannot leave this place.
Pray, take one of my men with you back to the capital.
He will speak in my place. You do Fournival a service, ser, and us with him.
I will send word ahead for a man to await you. Pray, speak to him directly.
I'll arrange for a man to speak on Fournival's behalf. Pray, speak with him directly.
A word, ser!
Are you the Arisen? I bring a message from the duke himself.
His Grace has judged your feat in slaying the hydra most laudable.
To honor your noble works, you are hereby welcomed to the Wyrm Hunt.
You may now accept orders from Ser Maximilian, Captain of the Hunt.
Bring this writ to Ser Maximilian, outside the castle gates. He will instruct you further.
That document confers the status of hunter upon you. Carry it on your person always.
Here!?
There's time yet. You can still turn back.
Get. Out.
You're lower than dust.
You're not welcome here.
What?
You haven't left yet?
There's naught for you here.
Don't think you're welcome among us.
Do you fear harpies like us?
Well met, then.
Hmm, you look well.
Uh!
Waugh!
Aaaaah...
Ya!
Eaagh!
Mm, you're looking well.
Another time.
Yes, yes.
Now that's a laugh.
Why, thank you.
That's quite nice, thank you, love.
You seem a goodly sort, but I've closed shop for a spell. If it's pleasure you're after, seek it with another.
Truth be told, there are not a few of us asking what sense lies in working, what with the dragon set to come.
'Tis easiest to live by clinging to another for all your needs, that's true...
But the world's not always so kind as to furnish a partner.
Still, life need not be pretty, aye? It need only soldier on.
Truth be told, there are not a few of us asking what sense lies in working, what with the dragon set to come.
I've heard the talk, love. You're the duke's new favorite, eh?
I'm envious. I'll bet you've not missed a meal in recent memory.
Though I s'pose that's a privilege bought by placing yourself in harm's way, eh...
For all the fame and fortune, Arisen's not a role I'd soon play.
You've my pity, love.
That was an awful din what rose up at the west end of the city. I saw the beast flappin' about myself, I did.
The thickest walls of heaviest stone aren't worth a thing when aught like that can just fly in.
Gran Soren's not safe, truly. Nowhere is.
It's so... It's so absurd...
There's naught for it but to...to laugh!
That's quite nice, thank you, love.

Perhaps we'd best ask the Mother<cf>Superior for more detail.
Let us hear everything the Mother<cf>Superior has to say.
We can find that which the Mother<cf>Superior seeks in the catacombs.
We might find such a thing for sale in<cf>Gran Soren's markets.
It can be bought in Gran Soren's markets,<cf>though the price is dear indeed.
Shall we scour the catacombs, then?<cf>Or simply purchase it?
Seems she holds you quite dear, Arisen.
The Mother Superior awaits us,<cf>and Quina's gift as well.
We've found what the Mother Superior<cf>asked of us.
Let us make for the abbey.
The Mother Superior will be eagerly<cf>awaiting this.
If only we had some light...
I believe we may find what we seek here in<cf>the catacombs, but...
Buy it with coin in the markets, or with<cf>steel in the catacombs; 'tis your choice.
Nooo!
To safety! Quickly!
Flee the shore!
Uh.
Ungh...
Hnnngh...
Hah!
Eagh!
Aught I can help you with?
You are ever welcome.
Yes, yes.
No, no.
My, my. How thoughtful.
Ha ha ha, this is a kindness indeed.
Ahh, yes. Let's have a look.
Mm, this may take some time. I shall begin forthwith.
I beg your patience, ser.
I fear the text will take a while yet.
Pray, be patient, ser. One text at a time, if you please.
The text is deciphered, ser.
Pray, take this with you.
Hmm... Though it grieves me to say, this is beyond my ken, ser.
Ahh, found something, have you? Pray, let me have a look.
Would that the prophecy had been a bit more specific, eh?
Record of the dragon's scourge goes back to the earliest of scripture.
But why? What meaning does this cycle hold? On that, the Faith is silent.
In truth, there may be things in this life the Maker Himself does not know.
Though to say it is to court the ire of Father Clemente.
I fear I am remiss in introducing myself. I am called Auster.
I am both a servant of the Faith and a scholar of man's faith at large.
I make no demand of age or origin where rare writings are concerned.
If you find such a text, I would eagerly read it.
Truly, this is a happening beyond all expectation!
The dragon is fallen, and the capital with it. I cannot but call it fascinating!
And you, the force behind it all, no less so.
Aught I can help you with?
Ha ha ha, this is a kindness indeed.
I oft ponder what it is to be a knight. How we're fit to live and die.
Noble, proud, and above all, strong... That is what makes a knight, truly.
I am not a boastful man, but I take pride in having ever striven to be those things in life.
The office of Arisen is no less worthy a calling, and a life lived in the service of a cause is ever greater for it.
Stay and learn the art of war.
You've already proven your great potential, ser. Train with me if you would further hone your skill.
The office of the Arisen is a worthy calling, and a life lived in the service of a cause is ever greater for it.
Stay and learn the art of war.
You've already proven your great potential, ser. Train with me if you would further hone your skill.
Undergo training
Not now
Good! Let us begin at once!
Not ready just yet, eh? Then it cannot be helped.
The challenge is failed, ser.
I'd hoped for a better result... 'Tis a shame.
Well? Can you endure more, ser?
Yes
No
Well said! Show me the strength of your resolve!
Finished, are you? Very well... No shame in returning after honing yourself elsewhere.
Well done. 'Tis a success I'll not dispute.
But know that the true test begins now. I shall be your opponent.
You need spare me no concern. Do your worst, ser!
Good. That's the way. ...Though you look as though you're hungry yet for more.
Well, worry not. I shall be your next opponent. Do your worst, ser!
Excellent! You've well proven your grit, Arisen.
I shall sleep well anights knowing you've the strength to meet the challenges of your journey.
I now see there was no call to test you, ser. I shall ever be here to aid you in further tempering your skills.
A fine show of prowess, ser. All would agree!
It pleases me to see you so diligent in tempering your skills. Pray, call upon me any time.
A sorry sight... What doubt stayed your hand, ser?
If it was pity for an old soldier, cast it aside here and now! Such sentiment will not avail you in the field of battle.
Whatever the cause, I expected overmuch of you. 'Tis an unfortunate result.
Put your spirit into it, child! You'll not slay a newborn pup with such a timid stance!
Is the Arisen truly so frail a creature? If so, I fear the world is well and truly lost.
'Tis our final battle.<cf>We stand together!
There's naught to fear, Arisen.<cf>No force can shake our shared resolve.
I... I fear this pawn cannot<cf>help you decide.
Speak your mind, Master,<cf>and this pawn will follow.
I've no words to offer you, Arisen.
A strong will is needed to sustain the<cf>world...and one stronger still to end it.
What meaning do words hold now,<cf>in the face of all this?
Yes, fight, Arisen, as you ere have fought in coming here!
What is it that impels you? What force spurs you on?
What sustained your wanderings and led you here?
I ask you: What is it that makes you alive?
'Tis volition. Unbending will.
You are here because you willed it, Arisen. That alone has brought you here!
Let us continue, Arisen.
Show that you are more than an empty vessel, animated by forces unseen...
Show that the temper of your soul is strong enough to command far more than mere pawns...
Show that your will is fit to bind the fraying circle of this world and hold it fast...
Fight tooth and claw. Struggle now, and cling to life.
Show that living holds worth enough to fight for!
Yes, stoke the flame of your will to survive. To be victorious! Temper your soul in its heat!
The forge of my heart grows cold, and the world shivers for it.
Know this, Arisen: The world is merciless... Cold and empty, for all its beauty.
It is an ever-turning wheel, perfect beyond compare.
I stand at its center, as you may come to stand in turn.
It is my will that keeps it spinning. My will that urges time onward through eternity.
Our kind must fight, and through fighting prove the temper of our will.
It is a fight that knows no end...
It repeats upon itself, that all the world may repeat with it. And so the cycle continues, forever and ever and ever...
New-crowned sovereign and keeper of eternity, grant me now this single boon:
The fire of my life is spent and guttering. Give me freedom with the kiss of the Godsbane blade.
If there is aught you wish to know afore my death, you need but ask.
Question the Seneschal
Wield the Godsbane blade
Do nothing
My knowledge, as my all, is yours to take. What would you hear of me?
What is the Seneschal?
How is the world composed?
What is eternity?
What is will?
Nothing more.
The Seneschal is steward to the world... The world you traveled now rests in your care.
Just as the Arisen calls pawns into being and sets them to motion, the Seneschal holds dominion over all living things.
There are those who would call such a being Maker, or God.
I cannot deny the claim, any more than affirm it. In the end, they are but words.
Call it what you will, such is the office I have served, just as those before me and you beyond, unto eternity...
The pawns exist astride the rift. They speak of a multitude of worlds, each infinite unto itself.
Limitless in span and lost to time, these worlds extend in an eternal, perfect loop.
Just as a ring lacks start and end, so this world has no origin, no final terminus...
If it does, they lie beyond our ken.
We are prisoners of unpassing time, wandering an unending land. What lies beyond, we cannot know.
Aye, there is life in the world, and with it death. Naught lasts forever. Each rises and falls in its time.
But such is a death akin to that of pawns.
They appear in this world, then vanish only to appear again, like bubbles in a mountain spring.
As so it is with all that lives within this eternal world.
In time, you will come to see it happen under your watch as Seneschal.
Each beast, each blade of grass, each human life is born to die and be born again in endless rhythm.
Naught lasts forever, yet all persists unto eternity.
Will is that which led you to this place, and that which turns the eternal wheel of the world.
Along the endless string of life and death, there are some born with a hunger.
They yearn for some other, better place.
They are the Arisen, nascent fountainheads of will.
And so the dragon is sent into the world to guide the Arisen, and refine them. To temper their wills into aught capable of sustaining the world.
And so the cycle of our world has e'er continued.
As you wish, Seneschal. Yours is the will that drives the world, the axis 'round which it turns.
And turn it shall in perpetual peace, for as long as your will stands firm.
And ere the day your soul runs dry, parched in the endless act of creation, another shall arise.
The newly Arisen will walk their path and come to you, as you have come to me.
Until that day, I pray you will guide the world justly.
I am defeated, and in defeat my role is ended. Naught but an empty vessel remains.
Pray, vouchsafe freedom to your weary servant. Grant me the mercy of the Godsbane blade.
Looking for trouble?
These malkins' claws bite deep!
We don't take kindly to trespassers!

Well, well... The Arisen, toast of all Gran Soren.
Does the work of all mankind's savior truly afford the time to go hunting petty thieves?
If you insist on a game of cat and mouse, what say we see which role you'll fill?
Aye, the cat has claws... And more grit than the fools in the duke's Guard, I'll grant.
But alas, I've not the time for games, ser. Farewell.
Truly, the Arisen is a profession given to leisure.
Or do you hope to earn your meals catching stray wizards for fear of actually facing the dragon?
Alas, I'm not one for company. Let us be done with this.
You've come to your journey's end!
Come again to challenge me, Arisen? Is our last meeting so soon forgot?
You're a fine match for the beasts you love to hunt. All hot blood and muscle, and not a shred of sense.
The Wyrmking's Ring is a talisman of incomparable character.
A vessel worthy of housing the whole of my magick!
What sublime bliss! What heady rapture!
Yes...I will see my dream made reality.
My essence...my very soul will inhabit the ring...
In it, I shall be reborn unto life everlasting!
My-- talisman... M-my ring...!
Think you're clever, do you?
This is true magick!
At least make it a challenge, Arisen!
You--!
And now we wait.
Aim well!
Damn...
Witch, hexer -- name her as you will...
Any who consort with the wyrm must be brought in and questioned, I say.
What--Your Grace?!
What devilry is at work here?
Devilry indeed! And high treason!
This brigand...has joined a covenant<cf>with the dragon...
and struck me with a curse!
He would tell you the beast is dead... LIES!
She would tell you the beast is dead... LIES!
He has become its minion,
She has become its minion,
spreading evil upon this land<cf>as upon its ruler!
Just look upon the hellish maw<cf>that gapes where once our city stood,
and tell me this is not the work<cf>of the dragon's dark magick!
Seize this traitor at once!
Well now, what have we here? Friend of the duchess, sneaking off to her chambers for a cup'a tea?
Must be a fine tea, what to come all this way in the dead of night.
Or perhaps you seek refreshment of a different sort? Like a turn in the sheets with His Grace's own wife!
Hah! 
There we are...
Ha!
Heh heh...
'Ow about this...
Damn. You're tougher than you seem...
Perhaps there's aught to this Arisen business after all.
How fares that tongue, Arisen? Is it loosened yet?
I've heard confession is good for the soul. Heh heh.
Hmph. Not near as much fun as I'd hoped.
...Don't you feel anything?
Come, friend. This is folly.
Confess, free yourself from pointless agony. Give us both a rest, eh?
You're...you're not human!
Quit stalling and talk, damn you! ...Talk! 
Tsk tsk... Some problem with your eyes then, Arisen? They seem to keep rolling back, heh heh...
Will you not talk? Will you not free yourself from this pain?
Maker's breath. Now I've done it.
Just as well. The dragon would have slaughtered this one in a heartbeat.
No manner of man can withstand such pain!
Well, I've got as long as it takes. I'll be back to play again soon, Arisen... Don't go anywhere now...
You will tell me what I want to hear. Won't be long now, eh?
Ah well, I'll save the real fun for later. You'll be seeing the Maker soon enough, though, I promise you that!

Dragon... The beast is come...
Rrgh!
Waaaugh!
I had thought...nay, trusted you were above the base treasons of Salvation's like!
The Night's Champion!? Bah! An oathbreaker of your ilk is champion to no man, Julien!
Salvation? Damn the lot of them.
And their idle talk of destruction and redemption. They were convenient to my purpose, nothing more.
The day of Edmun Dragonsbane is past. He will not slay another wyrm.
So what cause is served by sending men to die for his pleasure?
A swift death for Gransys is the greatest mercy to her neighbors.
And what of those of this land who will die for your peace!?
Will you stand idly by while a people lose their land, their very lives to a plague of beasts!?
You are no knight, villain!
Pray, think of the morrow.
The dragon will come again. To your homeland, and to mine.
Who shall stand against it then if we are spent, all of us, for having held to some ancient pact?
What is gained by all our deaths? Naught, I say. ...And naught would say your lord father.
How dare you, ser!? I will not suffer such slander!
You know it to be true!
Has he sent his finest blades? A general fit to lead them?
No, he's sent an ornament, though she be too daft to see it. 'Tis an empty show, woman!
Rrgh...! Bastard!
'Tis locked. You haven't the key to fit it...
'Tis caught on something. Perhaps it could open from the far side.
'Tis barred shut. Might be able to break the bolt.
'Tis shut tight.
'Tis no use at this hour. You'll have to come again later.
Best stop for now.
Seems they're closed.
Someone was here...
Lost them...
Gone...
Perhaps you've upset them.
There's naught to do here.
Best you moved on.
Not here...
The door is closed.
Shows no sign of opening.
There's aught there...
You don't see anything.
That smell...
Someone's near...
What's this...?
Fine view from here.
There's aught written here...
Must be a way to find something...
Smells delicious.
Perfect spot to place something.
You can almost reach...
There appears to be aught ahead.
That fall could kill.
'Tis dangerous to touch.
A strong blow might break it.
Perhaps if you came by night.
Perhaps if you came by day.
Perhaps if you came at dawn.
Perhaps if you came at dusk.
There's aught buried here...
You see no way up.
'Tis slick, this spot.
No use pressing any further.
No need to double back further.
No time for that now.
You cannot carry any more.
There may yet be aught lying about.
Seems there's naught you can take on at present.<cf>Best to try again later.
Perhaps with a bit of help...
Best you kept your weapon sheathed.
Is someone here...?
'Tis a place for tall folk.
'Tis a place for small folk.
Had you a woman in your band...
Had you a man in your band...
Had you a strong companion...
Had you a swift companion...
Had you a magick user...
Had you an apt climber...

This weapon will not help you.
That armor won't protect you.
You're ill equipped for this.
Seems it can't be used now.
You'll get no further use from it.
'Tis useless, now.
Hmm, not with your current equipment...
Not with your current party...
You hear aught from further in.
Enemies... They're close.
Best you got some rest.
You can carry no more!
You're too exhausted!
"Danger! Keep Out!"
"No Trespassing"
A sign.
Had you an Empty Flask, you might fill it here.
You'll get no further without a lantern.
'Tis dangerous to fumble about in the dark. Best find a light.
Best not just leave them.
If aught were left here, it would rot.
Best take care you don't get lost.
Best check the map.
You're due for a rest.
This place is dangerous by night.
This place is dangerous by day.
Breathtaking...
You'll get no further!
Seems you'll need to come back.
Nothing left here.
It looks fit to crumble.
Seems it could be moved...
It will not budge.
It will not open.
Seems you need a key.
Seems you need a Pickaxe here.
You yet lack the experience.
You yet lack the skill.
Not with your current vocation...
You'll not pass through this gate.
You've no time!
Seems you were too late.
You may make it, yet.
You're doing well for time.
Seems you've come at the wrong time.
There may be another path.
A large door... Opens by some switch, most like.
A large door... You see no switch to open it from this side.
'Tis shut tight. You'll need find the switch to open it.
Seems like there's an open space behind this wall...but nothing can be done about it just yet.
No further response, it seems.
Seems you'll get no further. Salomet's doing, you'd warrant.
No matter how you fiddle with it, 'tis still broken.
The lock opens.
A Ferrystone will spirit you back to Gran<cf>Soren in an instant, no matter where you<cf>are located.
It is by far the fastest and safest method<cf>of travel, but each stone disappears after<cf>a single use.
You can equip yourself with a primary and<cf>a secondary weapon.
Primary weapons such as swords and daggers<cf>are combat essentials. Secondary weapons<cf>like bows and shields offer support.
In addition to weapons and armor, you can<cf>also equip accoutrements with certain special<cf>abilities to give you an edge in battle.
Only one piece of jewelry and a single<cf>cloak can be equipped as accoutrements<cf>at any one time.
A heavy load will cause your Stamina to<cf>deplete more quickly. Sell or discard<cf>any and all items you no longer need.
Your lantern consumes oil. If it dims,<cf>use a Flask of Oil to refill it.

Select "Options" from the Pause Menu to<cf>customize your mini-map and status display.
The higher the fall, the more damage you<cf>will suffer.
Note that you move somewhat slower while<cf>your weapon is drawn.
Exhausting all Stamina will make you unable<cf>to act for a time. Take care to conserve<cf>energy!
You can attack while clinging to foes.
Petrifaction cannot be cured by normal<cf>magick, and is fatal if left untreated.
Use Secret Softener or the like to<cf>cure any petrified allies.
Your rank within a vocation rises as you<cf>defeat foes and complete quests. At higher<cf>ranks, a broader variety of skills are available.
Defeating foes and completing quests earns<cf>you more discipline, boosting your prowess<cf>in a vocation.
Pawns will collect and use items of their<cf>own volition.
You cannot carry or purchase items that<cf>would cause you to exceed your maximum<cf>encumbrance.
Press <TUTO><SIZE 25><ICON TOUCH></SIZE> while climbing down a ladder<cf>to descend quickly.

You can send off departing pawns with a<cf>single item as a gift for their creator.
You can pass items to and from your pawns<cf>on the sub menu.
Leave me, ser.
What? What is it? I've no interest in you.
We've had no end of suspicious sorts around lately. People like you.
'Tis dreadful dull...
Symone. 'Tis my name, Symone.
I've never seen an Arisen before. You've a...a plainer look than I'd expected.
I will admit, it does not sadden me to know I'll not be walking the city with my father.
He is a fool, and terribly common. You, at least, are a...a rarer sort.
...Very well. I've decided it. You shall be my page for the day.
You will do as you're bidden. Am I understood?
Yes
No
A fine response. We'll get on well, you and I.
We shall begin at the Fountain Square. Come!
My, my. The rebellious sort, are we? So much the better. I enjoy a bit of fight in my servants...it adds spice to the dish.
But you had best resign yourself, for I've made up my mind. Come, we'll begin at the Fountain Square.
The Arisen for a servant... Yes, I think I like this.
Tell me, page: Do you find it diverting to travel about slaying monsters each day?
I should think anyone with dreams of felling the dragon well-deluded indeed. 'Tis mad, really, for a human to slay the wyrm.
Still, Gran Soren will be safe enough, will it not? You'd hope so with all the guards about...
Just walking about is dreadful dull, don't you think? ...Ah!
You are a fair hand at hunting, are you not? Let's have a game of hide-and-seek!
I shall be the one to hide, naturally. Come and find me, if you're able.
I should think it a simple task for the Arisen. I suppose we'll know anon!
My, ser. I am impressed.
I had feared you would give it up for a child's game, but it seems you're not encumbered by pride.
You are late! What use is an Arisen who takes an age to perform a simple task?
And what of me? What if aught had befallen me!? You'd be chased out of town, you would!
Enough. I tire of this place.
Next are the markets. Come along.
Augh, I can go no further.
I am half-dead of thirst. Pray, go and fetch me some water.
In a proper flagon, naturally. Am I understood?
Ah, thank you.
'Tis a shame to waste you as food for the dragon, ser. You make a fine page.
Do you wish to see me dry up like a prune!? How long can it take to fetch a simple drink?
Tis backward for a mistress to wait on her page. Do not dally, ser!
I should think you fleet of foot, to keep pace with the creatures you fight.
What say you to a contest? I'll race you to... There! See that gate?
And pray, run in earnest, ser. I will not be patronized.
I won! I bested the Arisen!
'Twas simpler...than I'd thought. For a hero, you're...nearly slow as father.
Hold... Hold, I say...
Against a child, ser? Truly? Are you proud? I said to run in earnest, not to win!
I grow tired. I've had enough walking about for one day.
Father should be coming home ere long. Let us return as well.
You will escort me home, naturally.
I thank you for today. It was quite the diversion.
Are you very close with my father? I should hope to see you again soon, ser.
I shall allow you to accompany me any time you wish.
For now, take this. 'Tis a token of my esteem. ...Pleased?
Well, it was less dreary than staying in all day, at least.
Still, you are better paired with monsters than children, I think.
I weep for your romantic prospects.
Here. Go with this. 'Tis a token for your efforts, if not your results.
That was a perfectly fine day well and truly wasted.
I had hoped for a bit of excitement from the Arisen. A bit of adventure!
Truly, a sorry disappointment, and not one I'll soon repeat.
Still, I'll not be called skinflint. Take this and be gone.
Would you leave me here, ser!? Just where do you aim to go?
Come. You are duty-bound to escort me around the city.
Augh!
Halt!
Come along!
What are you doing!?
How dare you!?
Unhand me!
Cease that at once!
Not bad...
Amazing!
H-help!
Truly?
All right.
Very well.
I think not.
Absolutely not!
What would you have me do with this? 'Tis not what I asked for!
You're more useless than I'd feared. Now go and fetch me a proper drink!
I've important work for you, though some is of a less urgent nature.
The task at hand is just such a case. Will you take it on?
Accept
Not now
As I was setting about to find work for you, I came upon this slate.
I know not its origin, nor its age, but the writing it bears is old.
So old, our men could only read a few words. "Dragon," "scar," "Arisen," "heart"...
What little we know all points to you, ser.
Best you should have it.
If there's aught of import written there, we need to know. Your task is to find out.
Oh? Then so be it...
But know if there's naught else calling you away, the Hunt has need of you.
The words carved upon that slate are old, but there may be someone able to decipher it.
If it tells of slaying the dragon, it will be welcome news to all of us.
Come speak to me if you learn of its contents.
As a former Arisen himself, the duke might know aught of that slate...
But then His Grace does not speak of those days now, nor suffer others to inquire about them.
Not a text, you say?
A cipher, crafted to bring you to the Dragonforged... I see.
If this man speaks true, and is immortal, there's a fair chance he guided His Grace as well.
Be that the case, his words are well worth heeding, ser. Meet with him as time allows.
With luck, he'll lead you to victory as well.
Here, take this: wages for the work you've done.
Burn her!
Heretic! Heretic!
B-by the Maker...
She's a witch for true!
My greatest regret is that I will not see my<cf>homeland rebuilt.
Forgive me, my brothers... I take our dreams<cf>now to my grave.
I believed myself the one to end the great cycle. To free the<cf>world… Yet here I reach my meager end, lost in quiet oblivion.
Nrgh...
Gnnnhh...
Waaahh...
Yoh!
Yah!
Greetings!
Stay safe.
Yes, of course.
No, not at all...
Thank you.
Oh, how kind!
I understand wanting some time by one's self, but taking up in the woods all on your lonesome, like that witch?
Besides which, one lick of dragon flame and that whole forest is off the map! You'd be roasted like a pig on the spit...
Once I trembled at thought of the dragon, but no more.
Now my fear has hardened into rage. 
I despise that dragon with all I am!
We're but simple folk! Humble fishers of the sea! What's to be gained, going after the likes of us?
Ooh, the big, mighty dragon come to pick on the little people? Well, pish to that!
I simply cannot fathom why the dragon would harass a people such as us.
My husband says the Maker has a plan for us all. I try to believe him.
But if he's wrong? Well, I try not to think about that.
Goblins and Wolves are one matter, but how does one face down a dragon!?
It's huge, that one! Like fighting a castle with wings...
I've no taste for death, but we all of us meet our end sooner or later, eh?
Why spend the days wrung out from worry? I'm as like to drown in the ocean as perish from the dragon's flame.
The more mad this world becomes, the more unreal it seems.
I simply cannot fathom why the dragon would harass a people such as us.
My husband says escape the dragon or no, it's not in our hands to decide. He says fortune will decide our fate.
Well, if it all comes down to luck, so be it! I've always had good luck in my life.
Clemente tells us to pray to the Maker, but I...I'm starting to lose hope, even in Him.
The faithful have pleaded for the Maker's graces since the dawn of time, yet He oft turns an ear.
We give thanks when our nets come up full, yes...
But I've yet to see prayer calm a stormy sea.
Those who remain will not leave this village, even should the dragon return. 
I hear tell Madeleine took flight, but such is to be expected from a common peddler.
The men of this village boast they fear not for the dragon, but I know better...
It's sloth alone what keeps them from fleeing into the night!
We know the dragon will return, and when he does, none will escape his wrath...
Yet we go about our lives as if nothing has changed. It's odd, now I come to think on it...
If fortune favors me, I'll weather this storm. If not, I pray only my end is swift and merciful. 
There's not much else can be done, in truth.
Everyone names you Arisen, and yet you seem as lost as the rest of us.
I cannot say why, but I find some small comfort in that.
Until the dragon, I paid little mind to such thoughts of life and death.
In truth, I suspect few ever do.
I find myself besieged with weighty questions of late...
Why are we here? What purpose might we serve?
I beg you, tell me true: Have you dispatched the dragon?
Well, well, very good then... You have our thanks.
Course, I'm sure my good fortune helped out a bit, too, wouldn't you say?
Whether luck or the Maker guided your hand, I care not.
You defeated the dragon -- a feat for the ages.
You saw your grim task through to its end. That truth fills me with admiration above all else.
Disquieting rumors swirl about you, Arisen, but pay them no mind.
You are a dragonslayer! This world offers no challenge you cannot best.
Why are we here? What purpose might we serve?
Oh, how kind!
Welcome, good Arisen.
Hmm, three days, this one. A week, perhaps?
A favored game of mine, guessing the lifespan of<cf>those who enter these halls.
Nothing personal, mind. And rest easy, friend: three<cf>score guesses in, I've yet to hit the mark once.
Ugh.
Woh!
Waaaugh...
Mnh!
Mrragh!
Yes, 'ello.
Take care.
Aye.
Ah, no...
Thank you.
This is quite the happy surprise.
Have a look before you go?
Ahh, yes...
A fine choice.
If this is a jest, I'm not laughing.
<R_G>I'll not beat around the bush.
Right, leave it to me.
Taking it with you, eh? Here, then.
Absolutely.
Hah! You jest.
Hoy, there... Quite the pretty little item you have there, friend.
Why not leave it with me a while? I'll craft you a forgery fit to fool the Maker's own eye.
I'll have the goods ready by this time tomorrow. Call again then, will you?
Not quite done yet, I fear. Pray, give me a while longer.
Here we are. A perfect duplicate. 'Tis yours.
The other will take a trice yet. Patience, friend!
You're sure, then?
I fear there are none left to give you.
You've good eyes. Clear. Truth be told, I'm envious.
Most folk I see are too glass-eyed to tell an authentic piece from a crude copy.
There's no challenge. Selling my, er, "wares" to you, though...
Sure, my stock may not be the prettiest in the city...
But I deal in treasures no one else will. Best give my shelves a close look.
So, what do you say of my selection, friend?
Just raises the hairs on the back of your neck, aye? ...No?
Well, I s'pose there's no arguing taste.
So, what do you say of my selection, friend?
The duke? Now why would I place my trust in such as him?
Even the daftest of dragons will ill fall before a human.
So either the good Edmun is a fake -- not that I can cast stones there -- else he's no human. Either way, I'm not eager to give the duchy over to him.
If he's the sort of demon fit to slay a dragon, what's to stop him from demanding human sacrifices and the like? Nothin', that's what.
So, what do you say of my selection, friend?
The duke's gone well and truly mad with this business of researching the dragon.
Sure, there are writings of the sort left in ruins and the like.
But who's to say who wrote them, or for what purpose? The most of them are fiction and fancy, pure and simple.
Some self-important bastard with a bit of learning strings together a few lines, and there's your precious text.
A piece of friendly advice? Forget the duke and bring any text of that sort to private collectors.
You'll be far better rewarded that way, mark my words.
So, what do you say of my selection, friend?
Seen the city, friend? Quite the happening!
'Tis proof beyond question the duke's failed to protect Gran Soren and her people.
Thank you.
<JUNK>I'm sure you'll find aught you need.
Let's see what you have.
About your forgeries...
Never mind.
Just lovely, aye?
Let's see what you have.
About your forgeries...
Never mind.
I'll hear no complaints at my prices.
Let's see what you have.
About your forgeries...
Never mind.
Well? A beauty, isn't she?
Let's see what you have.
About your forgeries...
Never mind.
Any time.
Any time.
Thank you.
Any time.
<R_G>I'll not beat around the bush.
<GOLD>
Forget it
<EQJK>I'm sure you'll find aught you need.
Let's see what you have.
About your forgeries...
Change equipment
Never mind.
Purchase equipment and useful items from<cf>shops or wandering merchants you encounter<cf>on your travels.
You can restore Health and Stamina and<cf>advance the passage of time at any inn<cf>or resting spot.
A wealth of useful items can be found<cf>by vanquishing monsters or exploring the<cf>environment. Keep your eyes peeled.
You can see a full description of any<cf>item you possess by checking your<cf>inventory with <TUTO><SIZE 28><ICON PAD_SL></SIZE>.
Your vocation determines your basic<cf>attributes, wieldable equipment,<cf>and skills.
Once you have reached a certain level,<cf>you may go to the inn to undertake<cf>advanced vocations.
Rifts allow you to search for and hire<cf>pawns that meet your particular needs.
Speak with a pawn to enlist him or her<cf>as a party member.
Defeating foes and completing quests<cf>earns you experience, and each level<cf>gained raises all of your attributes.
Materials collected during your travels<cf>can be used at shops or other locations<cf>to enhance your equipment. 
A Ferrystone will spirit you back to Gran<cf>Soren in an instant, no matter where you<cf>are located.
It is by far the fastest and safest method<cf>of travel, but each stone disappears after<cf>a single use.
Portcrystals work in tandem with<cf>Ferrystones.
A circle of Portcrystals is set in the<cf>soil at Gran Soren, but another movable<cf>crystal can be found somewhere in Gransys.
Embed this Portcrystal in the ground any<cf>place save a dungeon, and you can use<cf>a Ferrystone to return there in an instant.
Wakestones are miraculous items that can<cf>bring your character, pawn allies, or <cf>others back to life.
Treasure each Wakestone, for the fragments<cf>required to form them are quite rare, and<cf>each stone can only be used once.
Gather enough Wakestone Shards and<cf>they will automatically assemble to<cf>form a complete stone.
This is your main pawn, the companion you<cf>created as Arisen. It will forever act as<cf>your faithful servant.
Under your guidance, your main pawn will<cf>learn and evolve its skills and other<cf>behaviors in the course of your adventures.
Pawns may also offer advice, as they see<cf>fit, in particular areas.
If you're connected online, you can summon<cf>pawns who serve other masters -- pawns<cf>created by other players.
These summoned pawns do not gain levels.<cf>Experience they earn transmutes into rift<cf>crystals when they return to their master.
Any item a summoned pawn equips will<cf>become a gift to their master when you<cf>relieve the pawn, and cannot be retrieved.
The main pawn you created can travel<cf>to other worlds online to assist other<cf>players in their travels.
These adventures can result in new<cf>knowledge, items, and equipment they<cf>bring back when they return.
Always make conversation with folks you<cf>see in town or out on the roads. Some may<cf>offer important information or quests.
Available quests change as you progress<cf>through the game. Additionally, you can<cf>always consult the "Quests" section of the<cf>Pause Menu for your current objectives.
If you have several quests ongoing at the<cf>same time, you can set one as "Priority"<cf>in the "Quests" section of the Pause Menu.
Doing so will make all people, places,<cf>and things relevant to the priority quest<cf>appear prominently on your mini-map.
Pawns in your party will also offer advice<cf>for the priority quest more often than for<cf>other quests in your log.
Notice boards across Gransys advertise<cf>quests -- errands and favors you can<cf>choose to undertake.
This game has an auto-save function,<cf>periodically saving your progress<cf>throughout your adventure.
You can also save manually any time<cf>you like by pressing <TUTO><SIZE 28><ICON PAD_SL></SIZE> on the<cf>Pause Menu.
You can also save manually any time<cf>you like by pressing <TUTO><SIZE 28><ICON PAD_SL></SIZE> on the<cf>Pause Menu.
When you're connected online, your main<cf>pawn's attributes will be uploaded every<cf>time you rest at an inn.
Your main pawn will gain boons earned in<cf>other worlds at the inn, as well. Visit<cf>often to keep current on any developments.
The Ur-Dragon is an incredibly powerful foe.<cf>Defeating it requires multiple encounters,<cf>chipping more of its health away each time.
When you're connected online, other<cf>players' progress will contribute to<cf>defeating the Ur-Dragon in your instance.
The reward you earn all depends on how<cf>much damage you dish out. If you're really<cf>lucky, you may even deliver the final blow!
A powerful, evil enemy lurks nearby.<cf>Beware engaging any pawns in battle, for<cf>they may be under its influence.
You can equip yourself with a primary and<cf>a secondary weapon.
Primary weapons such as swords and daggers<cf>are combat essentials. Secondary weapons<cf>like bows and shields offer support.
Protective gear can be equipped on your<cf>head, chest, arms, and legs.
Raiment can be worn in addition to armor<cf>everywhere except the arms and head.
In addition to weapons and armor, you can<cf>also equip accoutrements with certain special<cf>abilities to give you an edge in battle.
Only one piece of jewelry and a single<cf>cloak can be equipped as accoutrements<cf>at any one time.
Aside from basic protective gear, you may<cf>also find full-body outfits that can be<cf>equipped to the Torso.
Donning one of these outfits will remove<cf>all other equipment, except for jewelry.
You are unable to use some items while<cf>engaged in strenuous physical activity.
You cannot change equipment in the midst<cf>of combat, so make sure you are fully<cf>prepared before the battle begins.
You cannot carry a burden that exceeds<cf>your own weight.
A heavy load will cause your Stamina to<cf>deplete more quickly. Sell or discard<cf>any and all items you no longer need.
You can send excess items to the Gran<cf>Soren storehouse from any resting spot.
Changing vocations comes with a cost to<cf>your discipline, so weigh the decision<cf>carefully before you commit.
Each vocation accumulates its own<cf>separate discipline total.
Discipline points can be spent to<cf>learn useful augments and skills.
Skills and augments must be enabled in<cf>order to make use of them.
Your lantern consumes oil. If it dims,<cf>use a Flask of Oil to refill it.
Some items can be combined with others to<cf>produce surprising results. Experiment and<cf>see what you come up with. 
You may find shops or travelling merchants<cf>selling especially rare goods.
Some peddlers only accept rift crystals.<cf>They often carry uncommon items you'll<cf>not see for sale anywhere else.
You can dash by clicking in <TUTO><SIZE 24><ICON PAD_L3></SIZE>,<cf>both during and outside of combat.
You can dash by clicking in <SIZE 24><ICON PAD_L3></SIZE>,<cf>both during and outside of combat.
Weapons need not always be held at the<cf>ready. Certain weapons can be sheathed.
Carrying your weapon unsheathed decreases<cf>your movement speed, but reduces damage<cf>taken from ambushes and surprise attacks.
Select "Status" from the Pause Menu to<cf>view details on your current condition.
Place waypoint markers on your map to<cf>keep track of your progress.
If you've forgotten where you are in the story,<cf>select "Chronicle" from the Pause Menu to<cf>review a history of your journey thus far.

Select "Options" from the Pause Menu to<cf>customize your mini-map and status display.
You can raise your affinity with people by<cf>giving them items or completing the quests<cf>they ask of you.
Affinity affects how people talk and<cf>behave toward you.
Break any law, and you may find yourself<cf>arrested and imprisoned.
You can't use items or change equipment in<cf>the castle dungeons, with few exceptions.
You are free once more, and can use items<cf>and change equipment as usual.
You can speak with and enlist the pawns<cf>you encounter in town or out on the roads.
Regulations forbid pawns from entering the<cf>duke's castle.
When you visit the castle, your pawns will<cf>wait outside and rejoin you when you leave.
Be wary near any body of water. Wade too<cf>deep and you might be enveloped by the<cf>fog-like monster known as the Brine.
Wander too deep or idle too long in the<cf>water and you'll fall unconscious, washing<cf>ashore later at some faraway place. 
Certain items automatically become other<cf>items once you acquire a set amount of them.
The Black Cat deals in rare goods that<cf>cannot be found in normal shops.
If you misplace an important item, you may<cf>find it for sale here later.
The Black Cat can also create counterfeit<cf>versions of certain items for you.
These forgeries look just like, but do not<cf>possess the powers of, the real thing.<cf>Still, such items do have their uses...
If your party is overloaded, speak with a<cf>storehouse keeper to deposit items and<cf>equipment.
Anything in storage can be retrieved from<cf>any storehouse in the world.
You can also send items to storage from any<cf>resting spot. Keep your inventory neat and<cf>organized, and avoid being weighed down.
If a pawn possesses the right knowledge<cf>and skills, they may be able to assist<cf>you in tandem attacks.
Press <TUTO><SIZE 28><ICON LIFT></SIZE> to grab on to -- and climb <cf>upon -- larger monsters, at some cost<cf>to your Stamina.
Equipping armor meant for warriors of a<cf>significantly higher level than your own<cf>will drain your Stamina more quickly.

The higher the fall, the more damage you<cf>will suffer.
Pressing <TUTO><SIZE 28><ICON STAT_CHANGE></SIZE> will draw your<cf>primary weapon.
Note that you move somewhat slower while<cf>your weapon is drawn.
Exhausting all Stamina will make you unable<cf>to act for a time. Take care to conserve<cf>energy!
You can attack while clinging to foes.
Petrifaction cannot be cured by normal<cf>magick, and is fatal if left untreated.
Use Secret Softener or the like to<cf>cure any petrified allies.
Your rank within a vocation rises as you<cf>defeat foes and complete quests. At higher<cf>ranks, a broader variety of skills are available.
Defeating foes and completing quests earns<cf>you more discipline, boosting your prowess<cf>in a vocation.
It's only here you can enable the skills<cf>and augments you learn. You cannot change<cf>them out in the field.
Pawns will collect and use items of their<cf>own volition.
You cannot carry or purchase items that<cf>would cause you to exceed your maximum<cf>encumbrance.

You can send off departing pawns with a<cf>single item as a gift for their creator.
Forfeit pawns forget any new information<cf>learned on their journey.
People who bear an icon above their head<cf>possess special information.
Those bearing green icons have new quests<cf>to offer.

You may now take on Wyrm Hunt quests.<cf>Head to the castle gates in Gran Soren's<cf>noble quarter, and speak with Ser Maximilian.
It is time for you to begin your journey as<cf>Arisen. But before you can win your heart<cf>back from the dragon, you'll need to prepare...
Begin by asking around the village for clues.<cf>Someone ought to be able to point you in<cf>the right direction.
To truly know what Arisen are meant to do,<cf>'tis likely best to follow the pawn's lead.
Finally, you set out from the village of your<cf>youth. Take to the roads and head for the<cf>encampment.
Mercedes has taken the hydra head to offer<cf>as tribute to the duke. Head for the Mountain<cf>Waycastle and help her escort it.
There is plenty of information on the dragon<cf>to be found in Gran Soren. Take on some<cf>quests and explore the city.
Having met with the duke, you may now take<cf>on Royal Orders. Seek out Chamberlain<cf>Aldous within the palace.
You cannot allow the Elysion's plots to<cf>come to pass. Head for the Greatwall and<cf>stop Salvation!
You have felled the dragon and completed<cf>your goal! Report your victory to the<cf>villagers.
You've felled the dragon, but what has<cf>become of Gran Soren? After speaking with<cf>the villagers, best to see for yourself.
You progress through the game by<cf>completing quests. Always talk with the<cf>people you meet. They'll surely have<cf>aught for you to do.
If you've come to an impasse in a quest, try<cf>setting it as your priority quest to ensure<cf>you receive helpful hints and information.
Different pawns have different strengths, so<cf>use support pawns to tailor your party to fit<cf>your current needs.
Ecbal, located in the command headquarters<cf>of the encampment, provides many different<cf>support functions to adventurers.
Speak with him to rest and heal your wounds,<cf>learn and enable useful weapon skills, or<cf>store excess items.
This inn serves as a guild for local<cf>adventurers. Speak with innkeep Asalam to<cf>recover health, learn skills, and manage<cf>your stored items.
Additionally, once you've grown enough as<cf>Arisen, you will be able to change vocations here.
At times, people offering helpful services<cf>can be found at the campgrounds scattered<cf>around Gransys.
Speak with them to manage skills and<cf>augments, and store items while out in<cf>the field.
You may see peddlers hawking their wares as<cf>you make your way around Gransys.
They often come across rare items not found<cf>at more stationary shops. If you see a<cf>peddler, make sure to check what they have<cf>to offer.
Return to a rift or speak with pawns you<cf>meet to hire on a new support pawn.
Having been recognized as Arisen, you<cf>have been granted a loyal pawn to be your<cf>constant companion in your journey.
In addition to this main pawn, you may hire<cf>up to two other pawns to support you in<cf>your adventures.
As you take damage, the amount of Health<cf>you can recover through magick in the field<cf>also decreases, indicated by a white bar.
Rest at an inn or use curative items to fully<cf>recover your Health.
Periodically, tutorials will display to help<cf>smooth your progress through the game.
Reading the tutorials will provide you with<cf>gameplay advice and strategies.
You can toggle tutorial display in the<cf>Options section of the Pause Menu.
Seasoned adventurers may want to turn off<cf>tutorials and make their way through<cf>Gransys on their own.
This world is filled with different locations<cf>such as towns, fields, and caverns, all of<cf>which you may visit freely.
When you are uncertain how to proceed or<cf>cannot seem to defeat an especially strong<cf>foe, try a different location or quest.
Search for new locations, untried equipment<cf>or items, and people you've never met. As<cf>you learn, more experiences will become available.
There is no one "right" way to complete this<cf>adventure. Set yourself toward attempting to<cf>defeat the dragon, and blaze your own path.
Equipping armor meant for warriors of a<cf>significantly higher level than your own<cf>will drain your Stamina more quickly.
Giving pawns curatives to hold will allow<cf>them to use them at their own discretion.
In addition to minding level and available<cf>skills, a pawn's knowledge is another<cf>important part of creating an effective<cf>party.
Pawns with appropriate knowledge of quests<cf>or foes can provide helpful advice and battle<cf>strategies.
You can give direction on how you would like<cf>them to act in battle, and while out in the field.
Similarly, you can also advise your main pawn<cf>how you would have them speak to you.
A pawn's status can be determined by its icons.<cf><ICON ONLINE> means the pawn is online.<cf><ICON FRIEND> is a friend's pawn.<cf><ICON BORROW> is a pawn you've enlisted in the past.
Pawns take on different colors based on their status:<cf>Pawns with active covenants are shown in blue,<cf>pawns you have just summoned in orange, and<cf>pawns you are <KEEP>retaining in white.
Your Favorites list has a maximum size of 100 pawns.<cf>After that, to register another pawn, older pawns<cf>must be deleted from the registry.

Let us tell Arsmith of what we've seen.
'Twas ill luck to be seen here...
That guard has cost us our quarry...
Our quarry was keener-sighted than<cf>we'd expected...
We'll learn nothing, now he's<cf>discovered us.
There's naught for it, now we've been<cf>spotted by our mark.
Steady, master... Tread lightly.
Watch, too, for guards on their rounds.
Don't get too close, nor too far...
Keep your eyes on our quarry.
But what of our mark, master?
Need we not shadow him further, Arisen?
Then we will pursue him no further?
Perhaps 'tis best we not ask Madeleine<cf>her involvement in all this...
'Tis well suspicious... Let's follow him.
A knight of the duke's court, in league<cf>with Salvation? We'd best follow.
Best we return at night.
We're to wait here once night has<cf>fallen, then?
Ugh.
Guh!
Gaaah...
Ha!
Rragh!
How d'you fare?
Another time.
Right.
That's rubbish.
My thanks.
Howlen never forgets a debt, ser.
Many fled the city when tale of the dragon spread. But not Howlen!
By the Maker, it'll take more than one scaly bugger to turn me craven.
I've worked my whole life as a stonemason, you see...
Should the dragon strike our fair capital, it will be men such as I tasked to rebuild.
Assuming anything's left to rebuild, that is.
So the Arisen hails from Cassardis, eh?
Perchance you bore witness to the dragon's attack on the village then?
The lodges in Cassardis are of a simpler make than those here, no doubt.
It pains me to think of the devastation the wyrm must have wrought. 
I hear tell most of Cassardis escaped the dragon's wrath?
Perhaps the rumors have some truth to them, after all...
They say the wyrm's more capable than just any wild beast, and picks its targets like apples from a tree.
It's also said that, after each attack, the beast takes shelter, biding the days until its strength returns...
Could mean we needn't worry on another dragon strike... For a time, at least...
The duke's forces are broken. Perhaps Gran Soren's walls are next...
Aye, I've done work on the Greatwall. You'll not find a finer structure in all Gransys.
Even a hydra is nothing against the wall. The beast would bash its brains to soup against those rocks.
I'd wager a month's coin the Greatwall could even stand against the dragon himself! 
The Greatwall has fallen? For true? Just...toppled right over like a sandcastle? ...Well, bugger me.
If even the wall topples to the dragon's fury, I hold out little hope for Gran Soren.
Best flee now, while we can.
Have you seen the chasm? There's one hole what's beyond repair...
I miss the days when my greatest worries were which stone to fit, and what ale to drink after.

A broken riftstone. Looks like you might be<cf>able to restore it by using rift crystals.
Restore the riftstone?<cf>Current rift crystals: <RIMS><cf>Rift crystal cost: <RIM2>
You haven't enough rift crystals to restore it.
Yes
No
This seems a safe enough spot...<cf>Care to rest awhile?
...The hell're you doin' here?
Get outta here!
What was that? You want a beating?
Step away before I smack you in the face.
Who said you could talk to me, anyway?
So, you DO want to die!
Go. Away!
You're batty as a belfry!
Do I have to pay you to go away?
You again?
How goes it?
Yo!
Those bitches...!
This is ridiculous!
No way!
Best to have slaughtered them long ago.
They'll get theirs...soon.
Aye, we will...
Hmm?
Ahhh...
And?
State your business!
Who goes there!?
Where d'you think you're going?
Halt!
You'll go no farther!
O-oh! My deepest apologies...
What brings you here, ser?
I cannot allow even the Arisen to pass unbidden.
I would thank you to refrain from such actions in the future, ser...
What? Very well. I shall see to it at once.
A matter of a most pressing nature has come to us. Make for the southern waycastle immediately.
I've received a report that one of the duke's men has returned from afar gravely wounded.
He asks to speak with you in all haste, Arisen.
'Tis odd his message was not writ in the report. An oversight brought on by haste, no doubt.
Pray, fly to the waycastle and hear the man's message, ser.
Meanwhile, I am to see the duke on another matter no less urgent... 'Tis a restless day.
A matter of a most pressing nature has come to us. Make for the southern waycastle immediately.
Meanwhile, I am to see the duke on another matter no less urgent... 'Tis a restless day.
What damage have I wrought in carelessness! To allow an agent of Salvation through...
And in sending you away afore the creature was revived, the damage was all the greater...
While I, in my fool credulity, ran to the castle, only to be knocked insensate by some villain.
'Twas a lucky thing the beast was kept from the residential quarter. Augh, or the castle!
We must rethink the practice of tribute to prevent such a happening again.
For now, though, the danger has past... What of the damages?
Truly, ser, you are a wonder. You've handled the task perfectly.
The beast is slain and the treasure unscathed.
'Tis the first chapter of a new legend, ser. Or at the very least, a task well done.
No doubt... You have my thanks, Arisen. Your aid spared us greater loss.
The beast is slain, as well. In truth, 'tis fine work.
Still, I know you capable of greater feats. May your next victory be grander still.
Though the worst was avoided, losses of this scale cannot be tolerated.
I had hoped you might spare us such a fate, Arisen. I am grieved to see I was wrong.
I trust you will redeem yourself in future endeavors.
'Tis for the peoples' sake. I'll do it gladly.
I'm fine. I can still fight!
I'll bring you down!
Lord Julien is well enough, but Ser Mercedes is more burden than boon, talk is.
She's daughter to the Lord of Hearthstone, you see...
And for a knight sent to aid the duke, one hears precious little praise of her skill...
If the woman falls before the dragon ever arrives, we'll have another war on our hands.
Hail, good Arisen. What brings you here? ...An injured soldier? I've seen no such man.
I fear you are mistaken, ser. We've sent no urgent word to<cf>anyone.
What, man!? Gather your breath and speak!
What of the capital? What's happened!?
Rgh! The damned man's out cold. ...This bodes gravely ill, ser.
I've this place well in hand, ser. Pray, hurry to the capital!
Sounds like aught's happened in Gran Soren. Best you be returning, ser.
There's naught here to keep you. ...An injured soldier? I've seen no such man.
I know not how such a tale would have come about. ...Hmm, 'tis suspect.
Pray, hasten back to the capital, ser.
Some whore's killed the cyclops Lady Ophis kept for a pet...
She's terrible wroth... Worse than I've ever seen. Best you let her alone for now.
You're a man, aren't you? Then there is naught for you here, stranger.
'Tis lady Ophis runs this place, and you'll nary find one hates menfolk more than she.
She'll chase you off afore you speak word one, she will.
Ophis' only loves are gold and beauteous women.
Though I've seen a few boys with womanly frames and pretty faces in my day...
Mayhap she could stomach one of them.
Aanh?
The moment Lady Ophis gives the word...
I'll not abide your filth near me.
If you value your life, stranger, you'd leave.
Afeared? You should be.
Leave afore I chase you out.
Why do you bother me?
You've some gall to be strutting around so.
To living easy, friend.
Good health and good hunting to you.

Seems you need a key.
Seems you need a Pickaxe here.
You yet lack the experience.
You yet lack the skill.
Not with your current vocation...
You'll not pass through this gate.
You've no time!
Seems you were too late.
You may make it, yet.
You're doing well for time.
Seems you've come at the wrong time.
There may be another path.
'Tis a powerful weapon... Too bad it doesn't work.
Something strong can be sensed from the stone. It <cf>appears the memories of someone have been etched<cf>upon the surface of the Monument of Remembrance.
Then it's slain... Amazing. Ser, you are amazing.
I thought the Arisen little more than the stuff of old tales... How wrong I was!
Nh? The door...? The door! Of course, ser! I shall open it straight away!
Waugh.
Guhah!
Waaaugh...
Hmph!
Rrraah!
Hey there!
Till next time.
Aye, certainly.
That's a bit... Hmm.
Ah, thank you.
My thanks, ser. In earnest.
Have all you need?
Come to a decision?
Always a pleasure!
Come again soon!
We've new stock in.
We've cut prices, friend.
We've a special find.
How does this sound?
Ah, there it is.
Here. Take it.
Forgive me, I cannot.
You're certain then?
Aye? Pity...
If you're newly come to the capital, why not take the day to walk its streets, find your bearings?
These last years, Duke Edmun's seen to repairing worn fortifications and increasing the number of eyes out on watch.
Gran Soren's not the largest of cities, sure, but its walls are well strong enough to keep the beasties out.
All in all, not a bad place to live.
Salvation, eh? 'Tis a name I hear more frequent than I'd care, of late.
From what I can glean of their mad howlings, they have a strange love of destruction.
Myself, I'm quite enjoying this little life of mine. I've no use for them at all.
I suppose this death cult business may be their idea of a good time.
I hear congratulations are due, friend. Appointed to the Hunt, are you?
No surprise, given the fact you came to the capital with a hydra's head in tow.
I fear great expectations oft lead to great disappointment, but I warrant you'll get on fine.
You seem the sort like to weather just about anything.
I hear no end of praise for your feats of late, ser.
An audience with the duke, now? You've become quite the lordling. Impressive, really.
A fellow would be smart to get in good with you right about now, aye?
Just a jape, friend. Just a jape.
Is all well, friend? There's quite a noise coming from the western gate.
I built my shop in the shadow of that wall for good reason.
I'd be put out if we were not safe even here...
Take a look at that, friend! A clever trick indeed!
Here we all cower with our heads to the sky, waiting for death to come on dragon's wings, and the damned ground falls out from under us!
The Maker's played us all for fools this time!
And now, we... There's naught to do but laugh...
If death wants me, it damned well knows where to find me!
I've a business, and I'll run it till the earth swallows me up.
My thanks, ser. In earnest.

Are you the Arisen the men of the Corps speak of? You've a plainer air than I'd expected...
Ah, forgive me, I spoke poorly. I'd simply imagined a sort of figure pulled right from legend.
Pray, allow me to begin anew.
I am Asalam, and this is my inn, though we deal in a number of trades here.
I hope this is the first of many visits, ser. I am at your service.
Oh? You wish to learn of the pawn legion?
Then the shortest path to the answers you seek leads west from here.
There you'll find Gran Soren's Pawn Guild. It is a gathering place for their kind.
Just tell the sentries you have business with the guild. They'll let you past.
We are an inn first and foremost, but we offer more than simple lodging.
We can safeguard your belongings or aid in learning new skills, as you'll no doubt learn in time.
It is our pleasure and our duty as citizens of Gran Soren to help you and all Arisen.
Pray, come and be at ease. Consider this as your own home here in the capital.
Pawns are, to put it simply, sellswords.
They have the look of us, yes, but they are not human. They are crossers of the rift. In a word, different.
They'll laugh at jests, even join a man in his drunken revels, but there's a...coldness to them.
There's not a man can tell what a pawn is thinking, and that buys them no love.
Myself, I've no dislike of them. I've lodged many a myrmidon here, and eaten well on their coin.
...Mm? Ah, say no more, friend.
I must confess, I'd not expected the Arisen to share in Salvation's creed.
Though, truth be told, I'm far from a devout, myself.
'Tis a fight best fought with spells<cf>and arrows.
'Tis known that griffins hate fire.
I would think the bow best suited to<cf>hunting griffins.
Lightning serves little use against<cf>griffins.
We'll need to brace for lightning if<cf>we aim to hunt griffin.
An ally who can conjure flames will<cf>be a great asset.
Let's check where the soldiers are<cf>gathering.
Perhaps we should simply follow the<cf>duke's men.
We cannot reach it at that height.
The duke's men are assembled. Let's<cf>hurry to join them!
I see none of the duke's men here...
Would it come down if we baited it?
Griffins are ever eager to feed on meat.
Perhaps a goblin might also serve as<cf>bait?
Let's use a goblin to bait the griffin!
If we lured another monster close,<cf>the griffin may think them prey.
Seems a good place.
Let's put the bait out here.
...'Tis fled.
Remain here and we're done for!
'Twas all but done...
It makes for the Bluemoon Tower...
'Tis bled deep. Let's put an end to it!
To the roof. We'll find it there,<cf>I'll warrant.
Seems there's more than griffins<cf>about.
We've more than just the griffin<cf>against us.
We shall honor their sacrifice in<cf>kind. To the griffin!
We will avenge you, sers.
We must help the duke's men.
Give aid to any who need it!
The beast is slain. Let's return to<cf>the capital.
Why not collect up the tower's<cf>treasure ere we depart?
We must give word to Ser Aldous.
We'd best ask what the men of the<cf>Corps have planned.
With no griffin to guard it, the<cf>Tower's treasure 'tis ours.
I hear vast wealth sleeps in the<cf>Bluemoon Tower.
So, this is where we're to meet the<cf>beast... We'd best prepare for battle.
The griffin cannot fly far, injured<cf>as it is.
A wounded beast will seek its home...<cf>To the Bluemoon Tower!
This way, Arisen!
We'll arrive at the tower soon.<cf>Guard at the ready, Master!
'Tis the griffin's hold...
The hunting party is already within.<cf>Let's hasten to join them!
The beast has alit upon the tower's<cf>peak, most like...
I pray the hunting party fares<cf>well... Let's hurry after them.
Nowhere to run...<cf>We must defeat it here.
The hour is come to finish this!
That man... 'Tis the fellow wanted<cf>the grimoire! He's come to repay us!
Arisen! He's come to honor his debt<cf>to you!
Let us return to the capital.
A battle well fought!
All ready for battle?
The hour is come, Arisen. The door lies open.
Seek the temple atop the Tainted Mountain, beyond the Greatwall...
At its pinnacle, in the shadow of the wyrm, keeper of the endless ring, you will make your choice.
What you there become, only you can decide.
Oh!
Ough!
Waaaaugh...
Hah!
Yaah!
Faring well, cos?
Another time, then.
Oh, aye.
No, no.
Oh, why, thank you.
I... I'm a bit overcome, really.
I was afield the day the dragon struck the shore, but I heard tell you charged it where it stood?
I'd thought tales of you and the wyrm empty rumor till I heard count of your clash with the hydra.
I'm in awe, ser.
I'd thought you seafaring types rough of temper and strong of arm, but that wasn't the half of it!
Oh, that? 'Tis over and done.
Gran Soren, eh? I worked the markets there afore I came to this place.
Travel was easier in the old days, for lack of the beasts that prowl the roads these days.
Like as not there are monsters in the very halls of the duke's castle by now.
I came here from the mainland, I did.
Did a fair bit of wandering along the way, too, so I'm well familiar with the lay of the land.
If you leave the capital and set out around the gulf, you'll happen on a henge.
It sits atop a hill that bears the image of a man, carved large into the ground.
Atop that hill was the most curious fellow. The Fool of the Henge, they call him.
Each day I passed, he'd be there, just sitting. Like as not, he's sat there still.
Far past that henged hill, well around the gulf from Gran Soren, I caught sight of a tower.
Same one you can see from here, now I think of it.
Never been out as far as the tower, myself.
Half wish I had, now there's a fair chance the dragon will tear it down.
I talk of towers; it's just as likely the dragon will come for me. 
Mm? Why haven't I run?
Seems half a shame to leave, after traveling so far to get here.
But I know the roads, and I'm no stranger to walking. Come time to flee, I'll fare all right.
I've got no grand plans for the future, but what plans I've got don't include dying here.
With any luck, we'll all be spared. There's little sense in the likes of me fretting.
You felled the beast? For true!? Maker be good...
You see that? I knew we'd be spared, I did.
Now you've slain the dragon, I'd have thought the duke would be showering you in gold.
Eh, you've weathered trials more dire than this. You'll manage, I've no doubt.
I came here from the mainland, I did.
I... I'm a bit overcome, really.
You must think me mad to set off in the name of research,
what with the dragon so near at hand...
What's a fisherman gain from the study of<cf>plant and beast in the first place, eh?
In truth, I have no proper answer.<cf>I simply find such things...enjoyable.
I don't want to merely dream of the outside world.
I must see it with my own eyes...uncover its mysteries.
The journey will not be easy, I'm sure.
'Twould be a lie to say I do not fear the dangers ahead.
But...if not now, when?
I know wild notions oft have their way with me. Yet I feel... Well...
We are alike, you and I:
Two simple folk, thrust into a<cf>grand adventure far beyond themselves.
I'll not slay a dragon, of course,
but with the Maker's grace, I might yet aid folk in my own way...
Dawn is breaking. I'd best be off.
When we return from our quests,
I would be honored to share a cup with you again.
The beast comes! Hurry!
This pawn knows not the design or purpose of the small chambers here.
Be watchful for what beasts they may house.

Bones... Walking bones!
This must be the work of the<cf>darkest magick.
A warrior of bone approaches.
There -- human bones that move<cf>on their own!
This skeleton is skilled indeed.
Let's scatter those bones.
Maintain a careful distance!
Blunt damage will smash those bones!
Clubs and maces are a skeleton's bane!
Blunt weapons will do in a skeleton!
Back to the earth with you!
Missed its core...
I'll strike with sacred magick!
Fall before the light!
A powerful hit!
Don't stop, friends! Attack!
I cannot land a blow...
Holy magick will end its wicked<cf>existence!
Skeleton!
A drudge of skeletons!
There, Master! Skeletons!
A skeleton comes!
Skeleton knight!
A company of skeleton knights!
There, Master! Skeleton knights!
A skeleton knight comes!
Skeleton lord!
A party of skeleton lords!
There, Master! Skeleton lords!
A skeleton lord, Master, there!
Skeleton mage!
A band of skeleton magi!
There, Master! Skeleton magi!
A skeleton mage comes!
Skeleton sorcerer!
A band of skeleton sorcerers!
There, Master! Skeleton sorcerers!
A skeleton sorcerer, there!
They rampage indiscriminately!
Splinter their bones!
Strike their bones to pieces!
Crush their bones to dust!
Stop its incantation!
Move, afore its spell hits!
Curative magick is bane to their kind!
They fall before curative magick!
What heals us harms them!
Hurt them by healing them!
We must stay calm! One at a time...
We mustn't allow that spell to be cast!
I ill like the sight of those bones<cf>scattered about...
The undead must have some weakness...
Stay wary, even at a distance.
There's magick afoot...<cf>Faint, but there.
Such raw evil!
'Tis far too large to be the bones of any<cf>man...
Can those truly be human bones?
Skeleton brute!
Arms at the ready! Skeleton brute!
A drudge of skeleton brutes!
Edged weapons are ineffective!
'Tis quite skilled with a blade!
Scale it, and have at the head!
A knight clad in gold...
A knight of silver raiments...
That skeleton's mail is rather garish.
A golden knight!
There! A knight in gold!
A silver knight!
A knight in silver, Arisen!
Knights of silver and gold!
The golden knight stands again!
The silver knight is restored!
Each revives the other!
The knight of gold is fearsome strong!
Would we could dull the gold knight's<cf>strength...
The silver knight boasts near-perfect<cf>defense!
Is there some way to break the silver<cf>one's guard?
'Tis unsustainable to fight them blindly!<cf>Think!
They are a formidable pair!
It is revived?!
We must slay the two at once!
We'll ne'er defeat them one at a time!
A tremendous suit of armor walks!
Are those the soldiers that guard this<cf>place?
Living armor!
Over there! Living armor!
A clatter of living armor!
Magicks accomplish little!
Brute force is the only way to rend their<cf>mail!
Physical attacks no longer work!
They strike with sword and spell both!
I sense dire magicks from within that mail!
What evil dwells within that armor?!
It will take steel and magick both to fell<cf>living armor!
Enchanted weapons may serve!
Rgh, damn their shields! Strike from the<cf>rear!
Their armor cracks!
The armor is sundered!
Ah.
Aanh...
Aaaaaugh...
Nh!
Eagh!
How does the day find you?
Pray, excuse me.
Yes.
No.
I thank you for your kindness.
Oh, joy! My thanks, ser!
May I help you?
I am sorry. Another time...
Even at its worst, the world is ever home to hope.
Happiness finds those who wait in quiet grace.
Let us pray. For a brighter future...
We must turn fear to valor, despair to mercy.
War yields only sorrow. Loss and sorrow...
Let us pray. We can but naught else...
I thank you for your kindness.
It's massive...
Cyclops!
The cyclops is fearsome strong.
Its feeble mind is weak to sorcery.
A cyclops is susceptible to magick.
The brute is as slow as it is large.
Its eye is vulnerable!
It has but one eye. Strike it!
Rain attacks upon its legs!
It cannot hold a weapon with an<cf>injured hand!
Strike its hand --<cf>it'll drop what it holds!
An angered cyclops is more apt to fall.
It pays no heed to its feet<cf>when enraged.
It is wroth! Now, strike the legs!
The cyclops is enraged!
Watch out! The cyclops is wroth!
The cyclops fears lightning.
Cyclops tusks fetch a fine price.
Sever its tusks and they're ours to sell!
Snatch up any tusks you break free!
Now, while it rages -- aim for the eye!
Focus on the hand wielding the cudgel!
Attack it with lightning.
I'll strike its eye!
Now -- hit its eye!
A tusk is broken loose!
Shock it with lightning!
It's fallen!
It's fallen! Attack, attack!
I'll provoke it further still!
Those wild swings leave it exposed!
The cyclops is fallen!
Its leg will taste my steel!
Hit the eye with lightning afore it<cf>rises!
Tis mad with rage. Strike its<cf>weakness!
A crushing blow!
Now! Send a bolt at its eye!
Slay the cyclops, and its valuable<cf>tusks are ours.
Those tusks look hard as stone...
It falters! Strike now!
Now, aim for its eye!
Now, 'tis in reach!
Focus on its eye!
It's on its knees!
Its weight is all on one leg! Strike it!
It falters! I'll strike it down!
The eye... Strike at the eye!
I'll strike out its eye!
Let go!
Its legs are vulnerable! Strike it down!
This makes the eye an easier target!
'Tis like to rise to any taunt now.
Good! It's lost its cudgel!
I'll bait it!
Leave its arm to me!
A brilliant hit!
A cyclops!
A band of cyclopes!
There, Master! Cyclopes!
A cyclops, there!
An ogre comes!
Golem!
A batch of golems!
There, Master! Golems!
A golem comes!
Metal golem!
A batch of metal golems!
There, Master! Metal golems!
A metal golem comes!
Its every blow is deadly. Be careful!
Don't let it tread on you!
I'll strike its arms with lightning!
A bolt of lightning will send it reeling!
I'll stun it with a bolt to the arms!
I'll throw all I have at its arms!
No! Focus on the arms!
Its arms are the threat! Stop them!
I'll have at its tusks!
Let's break off those tusks!
I'll try to rid it of that club!
I'll disarm it with a bolt of thunder!
I'll see to that club!
Its club is a threat.<cf>I'll conjure lightning!
I'll strike loose its club with<cf>a thunderbolt!
Arisen, no! Come, lightning!
I'll send a thunderbolt to aid you!
Now! Cut away its support!
Sweep out its leg and the<cf>brute will fall!
'Tis our chance! Attack its leg!
Now! Take aim for its eye!
Cling to its leg -- throw it off balance!
The leg! Grab hold of the leg!
It cannot move with one upon its leg!
I've a hold on it! Strike out the eye!
I'll get that eye afore it can shake me!
I'll take its sight!
'Tis simple-minded. Sleep serves well!
Bleed its legs and it will fall!
'Tis wroth! Stand clear!
Blows to the eye enrage it!
Common attacks cannot pierce its<cf>armor!
Let's have that helm off!
Bleed its arm and it'll drop its weapon!
I'll grab its leg to draw its ire!
I'll draw its ire with a taunt!
A thunderbolt to that helm will<cf>anger it!
Waugh! 'Tis mad with rage!
We must do aught about its armor!
The helm protects its eye!
That club is trouble.
Perhaps climbing up to its helm...
That cyclops is armored!
A creature of pure stone! Be careful!
Each blow is deathly powerful!
Brute force will not avail us!
Beware that ray of light!
How can we stop such a hulk?
'Tis useless! It repels all attacks!
Perhaps if we aim for the lighted discs?
I'll try striking where it glows!
Those glowing amulets<cf>serve as its heart!
Strike at the glowing discs!
Those glowing discs are its weakness!
I'll strike that amulet!
Dash the amulet!
Crush that amulet!
I'll use a spell to expose its weakness!
I'll strike it with magick!<cf>Attack its weak point!
Magick ought expose its weak point!
I'll strike the source of that beam!
Aim for the source of its light beam!
A blow to the beam's source<cf>will stun it!
'Tis down! Smash the amulets!
'Tis overcome! Quickly, attack!
'Tis gone still! Now, attack!
'Tis gone mad! Stand clear!
Now! Strike at the source of the beam!
A golem, Master! Plated in metal!
'Tis a mountain of metal!
A metal golem is come!
Ahead, Master! A metal golem!
The mound of metal lumbers forth!
Its amulets must be somewhere in<cf>this wood!
A golem's amulet!
Here! An amulet!
I've found an amulet!
Here! A disc what powers the golem!
'Tis an amulet! Destroy it!
Golems are immune to magick!
Blunt strikes will best shatter the discs.
Take aim for its glowing amulets!
Only physical blows will destroy<cf>the amulets.
That light beam is deadly! Stay clear!
It drains the life of anything in<cf>its grasp.
'Tis dangerous to approach it now!
Its defenses seem down just after<cf>it fires that beam...
Those amulets power its movement.
That amulet responds to magick...
Destroy the discs that give it strength!
Ancient sorcerers oft used living<cf>statues to guard their treasures.
So golems yet walk the frontier lands...
That stone... A golem?
Direct attack is folly against a<cf>metal golem!
We must destroy those amulets!
There should be seven amulets in all...
Metal golems derive energy from an<cf>external source!
We'll find its amulets hidden about!
We must find those discs, quickly!
The final amulet!
I'll draw its attention!
They say a golem cast of solid metal<cf>awaits inside...
A metal giant is said to guard these<cf>woods.
The mist clears!
Impossible... My attacks have no effect!
Rgh... 'Tis too hard!
What is that light?
I feel a strong magick from that amulet.
'Tis enraged!
I-it stopped!?
So those amulets served to animate<cf>the brute?
It bears no amulets!
Is it metal throughout!?
I'll lure its arm down and have that<cf>helmet off!
A shock will break it from its rage!
Seems invulnerable while its eye is<cf>closed.
When it opens its eye, take aim!
It kneels! Now, attack!
Seems it eats anything it gets hold<cf>of...
It makes to throw! Stand ready!
Goblin corpses might serve as bait.
It... It ate the goblin...
'Tis gone mad with rage!
'Tis dangerous in this state, but<cf>its amulets grow frail!
Stone, animated by magick...<cf>A golem, Arisen.
A spell will expose its amulets.
It's stopped! Now!
'Tis still.
An amulet is destroyed!
Quickly! Aim for those discs!
I'll target its amulet from afar!
I'll spark an explosion!
Seems golems pay little mind to mages!
It grows wild when its amulets are<cf>threatened!
It's gone quiet!
How do we get at the amulets<cf>'neath its feet?
Now, while we can get at that disc!
It bears the look of a cyclops...
'Tis hideous, even by a cyclops's measure!
Gorecyclops!
To arms, Arisen! Gorecyclops!
A band of gorecyclopes, master!
Thunder is of little use!
Their single eye is their downfall as ever!
Strike at it with ice's bite!
'Tis more vicious than the cyclopes<cf>outside!
Their tusks are too short to cleave!
Avoid the spikes upon their armoring!
The giant has torn free of its bindings!
The thorns upon it make scaling it difficult...
Destroy the clasp binding its helm!<cf>Expose the head!
Is this giant, too, a prisoner here?
Perhaps we'd do well not to disturb it.
Shall we leave it be? ...Please?
Now, while it's doubled-over!
Let go!
It's fallen! Now! Attack!
The beast reels!
Now! Knock it off balance!
Almost there...
Not long now... Attack!
I'll scale its head!
I'll climb to its head!
'Tis fearsome wroth.
Ogre!
A family of ogres!
There, Master! Ogres!
A giant, Master! Ready yourself!
Don't allow it to take hold!
Anything it catches it devours!
No! Break free of its grip!
It's on its knees! Strike now!

It... It's too strong!
We've bid the people return to their homes. Please, Arisen, you must stop it!
'Twas a close thing, that...
Ser Aldous beckons, Arisen. Pray, make for the castle.
Bandits, Arisen!
Thieves!
A band of thieves!
They're armed, Master!

'Tis a pack of bandits!
Armed bandits, Arisen!
Be careful, Master. They're armed!
Rogues, Arisen. Be careful!

Careful -- they wield powerful magick!
If we could but still their movement...
Let's work together<cf>to stop that technique!
I feel a tremendous power!
We must break that stance somehow...
I'll venture a blow!
My life is yours, Master, until its end!
Grgh! 'Tis shielded by a barrier!
Rrgh! We cannot get near it!
A barrier... What now, Arisen!?
There must be some way through it...
Now! Attack the Seneschal!
I've got him! Strike now!
The barrier! 'Tis gone!
Now, the barrier is broken!
He's unshielded! Quickly!
That magick is deadly!
The barrier is returned!
The barrier regenerates!
Counter after they strike!
Wait for an opening...
Watch for their magick!

They attack in quick succession!

'Tis no ordinary human!
A person, here...?
Are they...pawns?
Ah.
Aanh...
Waaaugh...
Nh!
Eagh!
Well met, ser...
Pray, excuse me.
Mm, yes.
Oh, I don't think...
I do not know what to say, ser.
Th-thank you... Ser.
The duke assembles men of great valor to rise against the dragon...
I pray they are successful.
For all their majesty, I fear even Gran Soren's walls can ill protect us from the dragon.
At times I worry whether we are right to remain here...
Don't trouble yourself any further with that matter... I've made my peace.
I thank you, ser, together with my husband and child.
Life remains an uncertain thing, but the strength I draw from my family allows me to abide.
I have lost my home, and with it my hope...
Is this penance for some unknown slight? Or is the world truly so cruel?
What horror...!
To think, if we'd remained in our old home... I... My family would all be...
Th-thank you... Ser.
'Tis locked. You haven't the key to fit it...
'Tis caught on something. Perhaps it could open from the far side.
'Tis barred shut. Might be able to break the bolt.
'Tis shut tight.
'Tis no use at this hour. You'll have to come again later.
Best stop for now.
Seems they're closed.
Someone was here...
Lost them...
Gone...
Perhaps you've upset them.
There's naught to do here.
Best you moved on.
Not here...
The door is closed.
Shows no sign of opening.
There's aught there...
You don't see anything.
That smell...
Someone's near...
What's this...?
Fine view from here.
There's aught written here...
Must be a way to find something...
Smells delicious.
Perfect spot to place something.
You can almost reach...
There appears to be aught ahead.
That fall could kill.
'Tis dangerous to touch.
A strong blow might break it.
Perhaps if you came by night.
Perhaps if you came by day.
Perhaps if you came at dawn.
Perhaps if you came at dusk.
There's aught buried here...
You see no way up.
'Tis slick, this spot.
No use pressing any further.
No need to double back further.
No time for that now.
You cannot carry any more.
There may yet be aught lying about.
Seems there's naught you can take on at present.<cf>Best to try again later.
Perhaps with a bit of help...
Best you kept your weapon sheathed.
Is someone here...?
'Tis a place for tall folk.
'Tis a place for small folk.
Had you a woman in your band...
Had you a man in your band...
Had you a strong companion...
Had you a swift companion...
Had you a magick user...
Had you an apt climber...
Had you a skilled jumper...
This weapon will not help you.
That armor won't protect you.
You're ill equipped for this.
Seems it can't be used now.
You'll get no further use from it.
'Tis useless, now.
Hmm, not with your current equipment...
Not with your current party...
You hear aught from further in.
Enemies... They're close.
Best you got some rest.
You can carry no more!
You're too exhausted!
"Danger! Keep Out!"
"No Trespassing"
A sign.
Had you an Empty Flask, you might fill it here.
You'll get no further without a lantern.
'Tis dangerous to fumble about in the dark. Best find a light.
Best not just leave them.
If aught were left here, it would rot.
Best take care you don't get lost.
Best check the map.
You're due for a rest.
This place is dangerous by night.
This place is dangerous by day.
Breathtaking...
You'll get no further!
Seems you'll need to come back.
Nothing left here.
It looks fit to crumble.
Seems it could be moved...
It will not budge.
It will not open.
Seems you need a key.
Seems you need a Pickaxe here.
You yet lack the experience.
You yet lack the skill.
Not with your current vocation...
You'll not pass through this gate.
You've no time!
Seems you were too late.
You may make it, yet.
You're doing well for time.
Seems you've come at the wrong time.
There may be another path.
'Tis a powerful weapon... Too bad it doesn't work.

First time in the capital? Best find lodging first.
The inn's a grand source of news as well, what with folk coming in from all Gransys.
There's a fine place just inside the city gates. Just look for<cf>the sign.
Ooh.
Gruh!
Waaaugh...
Huh!
Daah!
Well met, my child.
Pray, excuse me.
Yes.
No, my child.
You have my thanks.
You are far too kind.
Come from Cassardis are you, my child?
I hear your village was the first to suffer the dragon's baleful touch.
It warms my heart to see you turn to the Faith for comfort in these dark times.
Mankind may never be free of the wyrm's shadow, I fear.
But there is light yet in this world, fit to guide us all through the trials before us.
As long as man holds the Maker in his heart and in his thoughts, the light of hope shall shine.
I fear 'tis too late to matter, now... Trouble yourself no further.
I was deeply saddened to hear of Brother Jean's passing.
I take solace, at least, that he died in the service of the Maker. 'Tis as he would have wanted.
May the Maker's blessings be upon you, as upon His Grace Duke Edmun.
Ah, yes. You hail from the same village as Quina, correct?
I expect Quina's interest in the Faith's records of the dragon stems from you.
She's come to us in order to better serve you, Arisen.
Of course, even at the Grand Cathedral, only a chosen few have access to the sum of the Faith's knowledge on the dragon. 
I cannot say whether she will attain what she seeks, but I think it a noble cause regardless.
It is said that even the best-intentioned scholarship of the dragon can soon devolve into heresy...
That is why the knowledge we have is kept safe within the walls of the Grand Cathedral.
You travel the land as an Arisen, do you not?
His Grace, Duke Edmun Dragonsbane, once did the same.
His Grace avers it was the Maker's hand guided him to slay the dragon in his youth.
Even now, not a day passes without him visiting to offer prayers of thanks.
You would do well to follow His Grace's example, young Arisen.
May the light of the Maker shine upon you.
Mm? Did you not hear from Quina, my child? She is gone to the abbey to the west.
I felt moved to assist her in her quest, such was her diligence and passion.
And so I spoke with Sister Hilde and asked that Quina be allowed into the abbey.
The Mother Superior there once served at the Grand Cathedral.
I thought perhaps she might be able to aid Quina in reaching the mainland.
I've no doubt that a woman of Quina's determination will succeed at the abbey.
With luck, it may become the next stone in her path to the Grand Cathedral.
Fournival's acquittal has spared us all the sight of needless bloodshed.
For that, at least, I am grateful.
I had long known Fournival to be the sort to invite suspicion...
But I would never have expected such an end.
It is a part of the Maker's design, as all things. And yet... Hmm...
It has long been custom for the doors of every church to stand open to the Arisen.
The Faith bestows every blessing upon your journey, my child.
Indeed, the Arisen are of great value to the Church.
You hold within you the potential for mankind's victory over the evil of the dragon.
It is a duty, and an honor to live as Arisen.
Just as it is the duty and the honor of the Faith to guide the Arisen on their path.
In truth, the need for guidance is clear, though you seem a righteous sort yourself.
Some Arisen do not share your gentle manner, nor your piety.
I hear tell a stronghold vital to the capital's defense has fallen to insurrection.
A sad thing, for brother to turn against brother in such times... Salvation's work, no doubt.
Those brazen heretics have given the Faith no end of trouble in their worship of the beast.
Mercy be upon us, the dragon wakes!
Go with my every blessing, Arisen.
May the Maker steel you against the evil you face, that you may prevail in this dark hour.
So much has happened, I can scarce keep up with it, either.
In all the Faith's records, I've read no account of the earth yawning to swallow up a city.
There are those who say you joined a pact with the dragon, Arisen. That you cursed this land...
I do not wish it true, my child.
For the child of man to possess such power... Even for the Arisen, it must not be so!
I beg of you, Arisen...
Say now that you have not turned your back upon the Maker!
Evil! Such vile and baleful evil!
You are far too kind.

Aaaugh!

No!
Mi, e'squuorau ait...
Mi, quonto la po'on.
If you would face me...
Take up arms, newly Arisen.
Guh!
Gaah!
Waaaugh...
Hmph!
Shaaah!
Well met, ser!
Go in good health!
Aye, just so!
You're wrong!
My thanks!
I thank you, from the depths of my heart!
If you've come to train, I beg your patience.
I have preparations still to make.
Seems your training has come to bear fruit, eh, Arisen?
You see it, don't you?
The flow of one blow into the next in perfect harmony... A master fights efficiently. Gracefully.
I once saw it clear, myself, though I catch only shadows and glimpses now.
Perhaps I've naught left to teach.
Grasped the trick of commanding pawns, have you?
Do not try to force your every thought upon them. Rather, guide the current of their actions. That's the key.
'Tis a hard thing to sense ere you grow used to it, I'll grant you.
But once you come to see those currents, you'll find a wealth of new tactics in your arsenal.
These star-eyed boys of late are all ambition with nary a sniff of talent.
When training demands the first effort, they flee one faster than the next.
I know their lot all too well -- eager to spill some blood, vent their spleens... War is but a lark to them.
Such caprice can ill defend this camp, to say naught of all Gransys. 'Tis a sorry thing...
Things have taken a dark turn indeed...
Still, a warrior who loses composure loses the day. Remember that.
I'll not let omens stay my training, no matter how dire. We need hone our edge keener than ever now, Arisen.
Hrmm... I fear I've no time for training now.
I thank you, from the depths of my heart!

I oft ponder what it is to be a knight. How we're fit to live and die.
Noble, proud, and above all, strong... That is what makes a knight, truly.
I am not a boastful man, but I take pride in having ever striven to be those things in life.
The office of Arisen is no less worthy a calling, and a life lived in the service of a cause is ever greater for it.
Stay and learn the art of war.
You've already proven your great potential, ser. Train with me if you would further hone your skill.

Not now
Good! Let us begin at once!
Not ready just yet, eh? Then it cannot be helped.
The challenge is failed, ser.
I'd hoped for a better result... 'Tis a shame.
Well? Can you endure more, ser?
Yes
No
Well said! Show me the strength of your resolve!
Finished, are you? Very well... No shame in returning after honing yourself elsewhere.
Well done. 'Tis a success I'll not dispute.
But know that your true test begins now. I shall be your opponent.
You need spare me no concern. Do your worst, ser!
Good. That's the way. ...Though you look as though you're hungry yet for more.
Well, worry not. I shall be your next opponent. Do your worst, ser!
Excellent! You've well proven your grit, Arisen.
I shall sleep well anights knowing you've the strength to meet the challenges of your journey.
I now see there was no call to test you, ser. I shall ever be here to aid you in further tempering your skills.
A fine show of prowess, ser. All would agree!
It pleases me to see you so diligent in tempering your skills. Pray, call upon me any time.
A sorry sight... What doubt stayed your hand, ser?
If it was pity for an old soldier, cast it aside here and now! Such sentiment will not avail you in the field of battle.
Whatever the cause, I expected overmuch of you. 'Tis an unfortunate result.
Put your spirit into it, child! You'll not slay a newborn pup with such a timid stance!
Is the Arisen truly so frail a creature? If so, I fear the world is well and truly lost.

By the dragon, perhaps, else the Maker himself.
Whoe'er waits at the end of your path, you're bound to walk it. I'll not hold you here.

Taking care of yourself?
Rest is a part of work, too.
You're right there.
Not so.
Ah, my thanks.
I thank you for the sentiment.
Can't go near the water for fear of monsters?
Best you watch yourself.
That damnable wyrm left most our boats in splinters.
I worry about the boats...they can be mended, or built anew.
We've more pressing concerns than catching fish, now.
Arisen, you say? What, you aim to leave the sea, then?
If the chief has said naught to stop you, neither will I...
All this talk of dragons and doom has people going mad.
Times like these, a man should steel himself and live life same as he always has.
I'll wager the folk in the capital spend their days watching the sky for the wyrm's coming, eh?
I have said it before: Times like these, there's naught gained from fretting.
I'm not blaming you, mind...
But Elonzo's grown timid since that day on the shore. Skittish, even.
He has not done a bit of decent work since.
Elonzo showed real promise as a shipwright, afore the dragon came.
You will not see the likes of Elonzo following after you.
Not just Elonzo, mind, and I'll not call the boy craven.
Most folk just don't have it in them to strike off on a journey like yourself.
You are a strange one, true enough. Might be that's why they all call you the Arisen.
The way I see it, you and Elonzo are not so different.
He is strong as you, and just as brave, I'd warrant.
You thought to take action, and action you have.
That's the heart of it, least as I see it.
You have done it, have you?
Might be it's not my place to say, being just a shipwright...
But a craftsman cannot so much as strike a nail till he trusts he can.
Same goes a hundred times over for building a whole boat.
The fact you slayed the dragon shows your own resolve.
You knew in your heart you could do it, and so you have.
Taking care of yourself?
Ah, my thanks.
Master!
...MASTER!
You're not...
Your face is his, but...<cf>You're not...
No... But he's here, now. Still.
Your face is hers, but...<cf>You're not...
No... But she's here, now. Still.
I... I'm sure of it...
Aye, if we're so ordered. The rest of the Conclave's design relies on those skeletons to draw off the duke's attention.
I'll grant you their blood thirst is greater than I'd thought...
'Tis time to send word to the others. Come, no more doubts, brother. You're to begin work under the Conclave soon, no?
Fare well, then. Go prove them right for choosing you, brother.
Ah, and if you're bound for the Conclave hall, pray, save me an errand along your way:
This key needs returning to the usual spot.
You know the place, aye? The other messengers will have need of it, so pray, see it back safely.
You... How long were you there!? What did you hear!? The skeletons... Damn my luck...
I'll not hang for Salvation... 'Twas only a way to earn some coin in the first place!
They pay a tidy sum for finding new believers and sending them on to the Conclave, though I suppose my hand in that ends<cf>today...
Let's be civil here, friend. We're not enemies, you and I. Surely we can strike a deal that benefits the both of us?
Like, say... I give you a special bit of merchandise, in return for a stack of coin?
<R_G>Well? Will you help me put this dark business behind me?
Accept his offer and pay <NOTE>10,000</NOTE>G

Good, good... Pray, just tell no one it was I what gave you this, eh?
'Tis a key that will allow you into their sanctum.
What you do once you're there is your business, though I doubt you'll manage much.
H-hold! Pray, hold, friend! Very well, you've made your point!
Here, the key is yours!
Do as you please with it!
What? What now? You've taken all I can offer. Pray, leave me in peace.
I-I haven't spoken a word! Not a word, I swear it! You must believe me!
I'd no idea that was the Arisen! How could I have!? Please!
You...!
'Tis not over with them, fool! Hurry and find the one controlling them, further on! Go, and...
W-waaaugh!
...What's your problem?
My, my, what's this? The Arisen, wasn't it?
Tell me, what grand dreams dance through that head of yours anights?
Visions of conquest, no doubt. Slaying the dragon and claiming glory like His Grace.
That firm, set jaw, fire in your eyes...
I'm like to see my own dreams of conquest abed tonight.
Don't listen to a word that sad fool tells you, ser.
Feste? No, I speak of Fedel, my husband, though I suspect the dwarf may be the bigger man.
Fedel would have people believe he's of the duke's blood, but it's a bald-faced lie.
Truth be told, he was a serving man in the employ of His Grace's late nephew.
The boy's been dead many a year, by now.
To my knowledge, Duke Edmun Dragonsbane has no living blood relation.
A shame that solitude is not a beast a man can conquer with steel and mettle.
I have another confession, ser.
I am dreadful tired of this world and all in it. I simply hate it all.
My husband, the duke, his castle and all in it... Even food and wine turn to ash in my mouth.
Would that it were all ash in truth! I wish the dragon to come and put the world to flame.
Do you think I'm mad? If I am, I assure you I'm not alone. Far from it, I should think.
Persisting in this endless drudgery -- that's true madness.

We're headed for Gran Soren with a trophy for His Grace. We came upon it on the western road.
Truth be told, the beast was dead ere we came upon it. 'Tis less a trophy than a windfall.
Still, a creature in such pristine condition makes a fine offering. The duke will reward us well.
You've no place here, beast!
Fall back! Back!
Dark...ness...
This is Gran Soren, domain of His Grace Duke Edmun.
Only authorized travelers may pass. We're taking no chances after the last dragon attack. 
Mm? Ah, the Arisen...
I was told to expect you. You may pass.
I understand you're in the employ of His Grace?
You may pass.
If the rumors are true, the vile dragon stirs once more. 
I fear it won't be long afore the beast sets our city to burn. 
Madness! The entire capital is near to lost!
Where's the sense in watching over a gate in the midst of such chaos?
The careless who enter the Everfall rarely return.<cf>Let's prepare well.
This place is the link twixt this world and the next.<cf>We walk in death's shadow, Arisen.
Our task is completed. Let us return.
We are returned safe... Though 'tis not the last we'll<cf>see of that place, like as not.
'Tis regrettable. Next time, surely...
'Tis locked. You haven't the key to fit it...
'Tis caught on something. Perhaps it could open from the far side.
'Tis barred shut. Might be able to break the bolt.
'Tis shut tight.
'Tis no use at this hour. You'll have to come again later.
Best stop for now.
Seems they're closed.
Someone was here...
Lost them...
Gone...
Perhaps you've upset them.
There's naught to do here.
Best you moved on.
Not here...
The door is closed.
Shows no sign of opening.
There's aught there...
You don't see anything.
That smell...
Someone's near...
What's this...?
Fine view from here.
There's aught written here...
Must be a way to find something...
Smells delicious.
Perfect spot to place something.
You can almost reach...
There appears to be aught ahead.
That fall could kill.
'Tis dangerous to touch.
A strong blow might break it.
Perhaps if you came by night.
Perhaps if you came by day.

Oh!
Aaargh...
Hngh!
Rngh!
How ya fare?
Take care, now.
Quite so, quite so.
That isn't right.
Thank you.
Thank you so very, very much.
They say it was you what saved our village!?
We stand forever in your debt, all of us!
This here's a right disaster, and no mistake.
Most the village fled when the dragon struck. Ain't seen hide nor hair of 'em since.
Ooh, look...pawns! Them's the real thing? Will they do whatever you please once you gives the word?
Some don't care for pawns, but I don't see how they're so bad.
And drown me if I wouldn't take a few pawns of m'own! I'd put 'em to cooking and cleaning, I would.
Yeah, some'a the more excitable folks claim pawns for an evil sort. Can't be trusted and all that.
But no pawn's never done me ill, whereas I've had plenty'a humans what stabbed me in the back as soon as I turned it.
I hear tell of a hideous creature called a hydra roams these parts.
First your dragon, now this hydra. Just what's going on, I'd like to know?
It's right rude'a those monsters to attack us all ganged-up like.
Someone oughta whack off their heads with a broadsword -- teach 'em a fair fight!
Maker's blessings to ya!
Heard you've been afield on a noble quest. Well, you never were one to stay rooted in place.
I remember when you was just a wee minnow. Always running about the docks, giggling as the men gave chase.
Still wand'ring all over the peninsula, are you? You know we've a perfectly good village right here, "Ser Arisen."
Can't claim to really understand it...
But if you yearn to see the world, then go. You're young and able -- there's no better time for such. 
Aye, you're woven from the same bolt as our chief. Shouldn't be a surprise, with him whelping you as his own. 
A personal assignment from the duke? I can scarce myself believe it.
You're the gossip of travelers 'n such. I can only imagine what they say of you in Gran Soren.
Chief Adaro proved his worth when he whelped you. Look how fine you've turned out to be.
I've not seen Quina in many a day...
Some say she left the village to chase after you.
I can just imagine that fool girl Quina striking out after you, what with the two of you being raised from cubs together.
The chief wears a sour mask these days. I can only imagine the troubles he bears.
It's surely choppy waters for old Adaro. He feels pride in you, and yet knows you stride into danger at every turn.
Were it me, I'd lock you in a cage and stow the key under m'pillow.
I imagine you'll be off again soon. Gone to trample evil underfoot and put fell beasts to the sword and whatnot.
Well, there's more to life than stabbin' things, you know? Just be careful out there.
That shard-born belly-crawler's stolen away our Quina!?
That...poor girl... I can't even imagine...
Though I suppose it's more than just Quina what owes despair to that wyrm.
We all suffer in our own way, don't we?
All people languish in the wake of the dragon.
Oh, and I wager you've had a hard go of it as well. Don't mean to say elsewise.
It's this dragon what's turning the world mad! I wish he'd crawl off to a hole and roast himself.
I knew this day would come, from the moment the wyrm's shadow crossed our doors...
There's no escaping fate. Best put black thoughts from our minds and enjoy what time the Maker sees fit to provide.
Come on, now. Let's keep a bright outlook, yeah?
If you sulk about with your lip hanging low, a chicken's like to walk on it.
I knew you'd best that dragon. I just knew it!
We should throw a feast in your honor! I've a recipe for pickled fish eyes what'll make your mouth water.
And here I'd started to think dragons only slain in stories and song!
I'm right proud of you. Hero of the land, spawned from a humble puddle such as this. 
It's a cradle tale come to life!
It's a farce, I tell you!
How can you be hero one day, and cast out of Gran Soren the next?
Your story has more twists than a net left in the tides!
Well, it wouldn't be you if you didn't keep the village sick with worry.
No go out there and do what you must.
Maker's blessings to ya!
Thank you so very, very much.
"The delightful and ever-novel pleasure of a useless occupation"<cf>                                                            -Henri de Régnier
 
Ser Aldous must know of this.
Someone may know of Salomet's<cf>whereabouts. Best ask around.
Let's hear from some others.
Shall we speak to a few more people?
The ancient quarry is this way.
Shall we to the quarry, then?
The quarry is a spot well-suited to<cf>hiding.
There are two ways into the quarry.
I recall the north entrance offering<cf>safer passage.
'Tis a sorcerer we face.<cf>We must be ready for anything...
Let's press on.
We've lost him...
Someone may know whither he's fled.
Perhaps a traveling peddler might've<cf>caught sight of Salomet?
Perhaps a peddler saw Salomet flee?
All we can do is inquire about and<cf>hope.
I pray we might find one who's seen<cf>him...
Surely someone witnessed Salomet<cf>fleeing.
So Salomet's taken refuge in the<cf>Bluemoon Tower...
To the Bluemoon Tower!
This time we'll have that ring back...
We cannot allow him to flee with the<cf>ring again.
Salomet is sure to have laid traps<cf>for us.
His power's grown... The ring's work,<cf>no doubt!
The ring has granted him vast power!
Let's make our way upward.<cf>'Tis the only likely spot.
He must be above. Onward, Master!
We'll find him in the highest<cf>room, no doubt.
Ser Aldous awaits us.
All that remains is to see the ring<cf>safely to Ser Aldous.
Let's return the ring to the capital.
Our route matters not... The next<cf>attack shall come to us.
Do you see the tower, Arisen? 'Tis<cf>this way.
If what I've heard holds true, we'll<cf>find the wizard here.
He's like to be waiting at the tower's<cf>pinnacle. Let's proceed carefully.
Salomet is an infamous archmage. He's<cf>oft been seen in the ancient quarry.
Take heed, Arisen. We don't know the<cf>extent of his power.
Salomet! ...Underestimate him<cf>at your peril, Master!
If his attacks find our range, it<cf>could be the end for us...
He wields some ensorceled trinket...<cf>'Tis no easy thing to fight magick.
We must keep our distance. Don't<cf>let him set the pace of battle.
Beware his magick!
The Wyrmking's Ring lets him cast<cf>with haste. Be careful!
The Wyrmking's Ring... A potent<cf>treasure, indeed...
Follow me. I'll take you to the quarry.
The ancient quarry lies just beyond. Be careful.
Shall we return to Gran Soren for<cf>now?
Someone must know something about<cf>this matter. Let's ask around.
Let's keep going.
We're here.
Let us return to the capital.
I can bear to see no more death...
Call me craven if you will. I'll go no further.<cf>I grow so very tired...
None of it matters, now... None of it... Pray,<cf>leave me to sleep in peace.
'Tis locked. You haven't the key to fit it...
'Tis caught on something. Perhaps it could open from the far side.
'Tis barred shut. Might be able to break the bolt.
'Tis shut tight.
'Tis no use at this hour. You'll have to come again later.
Best stop for now.
Seems they're closed.
Someone was here...
Lost them...
Gone...
Perhaps you've upset them.
There's naught to do here.
Best you moved on.
Not here...
The door is closed.
Shows no sign of opening.
There's aught there...
You don't see anything.
That smell...
Someone's near...
What's this...?
Fine view from here.
There's aught written here...
Must be a way to find something...
Smells delicious.
Perfect spot to place something.
You can almost reach...
There appears to be aught ahead.
That fall could kill.
'Tis dangerous to touch.
A strong blow might break it.
Perhaps if you came by night.
Perhaps if you came by day.
Perhaps if you came at dawn.
Perhaps if you came at dusk.
There's aught buried here...
You see no way up.
'Tis slick, this spot.
No use pressing any further.
No need to double back further.
No time for that now.
You cannot carry any more.
There may yet be aught lying about.
Seems there's naught you can take on at present.<cf>Best to try again later.
Perhaps with a bit of help...
Best you kept your weapon sheathed.
Is someone here...?
'Tis a place for tall folk.
'Tis a place for small folk.
Had you a woman in your band...
Had you a man in your band...
Had you a strong companion...
Had you a swift companion...
Had you a magick user...
Had you an apt climber...
Had you a skilled jumper...
This weapon will not help you.
That armor won't protect you.
You're ill equipped for this.
Seems it can't be used now.
You'll get no further use from it.
'Tis useless, now.
Hmm, not with your current equipment...
Not with your current party...
You hear aught from further in.
Enemies... They're close.
Best you got some rest.
You can carry no more!
You're too exhausted!
"Danger! Keep Out!"
"No Trespassing"

Had you an Empty Flask, you might fill it here.
You'll get no further without a lantern.
'Tis dangerous to fumble about in the dark. Best find a light.
Best not just leave them.
If aught were left here, it would rot.
Best take care you don't get lost.
Best check the map.
You're due for a rest.

Seems you'll need to come back.
Nothing left here.
It looks fit to crumble.
Seems it could be moved...
It will not budge.
It will not open.
Seems you need a key.
Seems you need a Pickaxe here.
You yet lack the experience.
You yet lack the skill.
Not with your current vocation...
You'll not pass through this gate.
You've no time!
Seems you were too late.
You may make it, yet.
You're doing well for time.
Seems you've come at the wrong time.
There may be another path.
The floor gives off a curious light... And a draft, what's more. Something lies below.
That queer light... And you feel a draft, what's more. This must be it.
'Tis a powerful weapon... Too bad it doesn't work.
The victim of some vicious creature...
Whatever evil caused this no doubt lurks at the bottom of these stairs.
The lever's been removed. 'Tis useless in this state.
It won't open... Seems it's controlled by some<cf>device.
A lever is firmly attached.
If you continue on, you will not be able to<cf>return for some time. Make sure you're<cf>amply prepared.
Wakestones are miraculous items that can<cf>bring your character, pawn allies, or <cf>others back to life.
Treasure each Wakestone, for the fragments<cf>required to form them are quite rare, and<cf>each stone can only be used once.
Gather enough Wakestone Shards and<cf>they will automatically assemble to<cf>form a complete stone.
A Ferrystone will spirit you back to Gran<cf>Soren in an instant, no matter where you<cf>are located.
It is by far the fastest and safest method<cf>of travel, but each stone disappears after<cf>a single use.
You can equip yourself with a primary and<cf>a secondary weapon.
Primary weapons such as swords and daggers<cf>are combat essentials. Secondary weapons<cf>like bows and shields offer support.
In addition to weapons and armor, you can<cf>also equip accoutrements with certain special<cf>abilities to give you an edge in battle.
Only one piece of jewelry and a single<cf>cloak can be equipped as accoutrements<cf>at any one time.
A heavy load will cause your Stamina to<cf>deplete more quickly. Sell or discard<cf>any and all items you no longer need.
Your lantern consumes oil. If it dims,<cf>use a Flask of Oil to refill it.
Some items can be combined with others to<cf>produce surprising results. Experiment and<cf>see what you come up with. 
Place waypoint markers on your map to<cf>keep track of your progress.
If you've forgotten where you are in the story,<cf>select "Chronicle" from the Pause Menu to<cf>review a history of your journey thus far.
Select "Options" from the Pause Menu to<cf>customize your mini-map and status display.
The higher the fall, the more damage you<cf>will suffer.
Note that you move somewhat slower while<cf>your weapon is drawn.
Exhausting all Stamina will make you unable<cf>to act for a time. Take care to conserve<cf>energy!
You can attack while clinging to foes.
Petrifaction cannot be cured by normal<cf>magick, and is fatal if left untreated.
Use Secret Softener or the like to<cf>cure any petrified allies.
Your rank within a vocation rises as you<cf>defeat foes and complete quests. At higher<cf>ranks, a broader variety of skills are available.
Defeating foes and completing quests earns<cf>you more discipline, boosting your prowess<cf>in a vocation.
Pawns will collect and use items of their<cf>own volition.
You cannot carry or purchase items that<cf>would cause you to exceed your maximum<cf>encumbrance.
Press <TUTO><SIZE 25><ICON TOUCH></SIZE> while climbing down a ladder<cf>to descend quickly. 
If a pawn remains unconscious for too long,<cf>they will be forfeit.
Your support pawn has become forfeit, and<cf>returned to the realm whence they came.
Your main pawn has become forfeit,<cf>disappearing and returning to the rift.
You cannot join covenants with other pawns<cf>while your main pawn is forfeit.
Touch any riftstone to return your lost<cf>main pawn to your side.
If a support pawn is forfeit, any items<cf>they were carrying are sent to item storage.
You can send off departing pawns with a<cf>single item as a gift for their creator.
You can pass items to and from your pawns<cf>on the sub menu.

What d'you think you're doing!?
Bugger off!
Think y'er a big shot, do ya?
Shove off, friend.
Think you can just stroll around like the duke himself?
Keep pestering me and I'll answer you with my fist!
What are you waiting for!?
You're an odd one...
You really haven't anything better to do?
Still here, are you?
How do you fare?
Hoy!
Unforgivable!
This is a cruel jape indeed...
...For true?
We should've finished them when we had the chance...
This time, we won' be so forgiving.
Aye, aye...
What?
Ohh...
What next?
All this walking is beginning to wear on me...
Rrgh! I'll not die so easily!
You'll not escape!
Well, well... The Arisen, toast of all Gran Soren.
Does the work of all mankind's savior truly<cf>afford the time to go hunting petty thieves?
If you insist on a game of cat and mouse,
what say we see which role you'll fill?
Thank you. Your well-wishing alone is help enough.
I'm able to stand again, thanks to you.
For a time, I'd well and truly given up hope.
I'll manage well enough. Pray, see to the others.
You don't look like you're with a convoy...
We're awaiting important freight. Until then, I'm afraid you'll have to stay out here.
I cannot let you past.
'Tis a saurian nest! The walls are lined with cloaked fiends!
'Tis their spawning ground...
A clutch of eggs... Fire ought take care of them easily enough.
Destroying the eggs will draw out the largest saurians.
We'd best be done with the nests ere the greater saurians show!
This should rid us of saurians for a while.
So many eggs... 'Tis a larger clutch than I'd feared.
Saurian eggs are quick to burn.
Finish it -- send a Throwblast at the nest.
Use the Throwblast you received wisely.
So many eggs...
Burn the nest with a Throwblast!
A bit of magic will burn the nest to ash.
We must leave no egg whole!
There are eggs this way.
But, we've yet to destroy all the eggs...
We'll destroy the nest for good this time.
The work of a monster, perhaps?
Perhaps we'd best return from time<cf>to time.
A saurian nest lies beyond.
Seems we can pass through here.
A man needs see to his own safety.
Leave me be for now.
'Tis hard to find reason to go on.
'Ello, 'ello.
This smell... 'Tis an assault.
'Tis like a river of blood...
The footing here is poor.
'Tis a precarious place to fight!
Let us find an open place with solid<cf>ground.
I pray we're not attacked here...
Augh, the smell...
There's little we can do to brace for attack<cf>here.
Let us take a moment to recover!

D'you know of the Bluemoon Tower, friend? To the northeast? I heard a strange tale from a fellow merchant a few days past...
Seems there's a man's been seen coming and going 'round there of late. All the way out there!
What's more, they say he chased off all the beasts nested there with some arcane magick.
It's him, says I -- that sorcerer they say stole some bauble from the duke. What was it...?
Leave...now.
The fact that you draw breath offends me.
Go rot!
If you wish to die, I'd be happy to accommodate.
I'll not waste my breath on you.
You've no use for me, and I've certainly no use for you.
Know your place, outsider.
What is it?
Well met, cousin.
Life as a bandit is a fair bit better than life as Arisen, I'd wager!
What do you think you're doing here?
Be off with you!
You great ass, away with you!
Are you brave? Or just mule-headed?
This is no place for the likes of you.
If you wish to travel with the Reaper, I'll gladly pay your toll.
I'm not of a mind to suffer fools... I am of a mind to make fools suffer.
Your brain must be dryer than a granny's...hmph.
Can't you bother someone else?
Stubborn as an ass, you are...
I trust you are well?
Hoy!
Bloodsuckers!
They've really done it now.
It beggars belief...
This insult cannot be allowed to stand.
Now: the perfect revenge...
Aye, that is so...
What?
I see...
And what then?
Have you cast yourself into the void, ser?
It seems the shaft empties upon itself in a never-ending cycle, top to bottom.
If you would heed my call, prove now your worth.
Show that you've the strength to break the yoke that binds you.
I would ask aught of you, Arisen...
Please... Take this.
My mistress gathered their like as she sought her way through the depths.
She died ere she was done. If you would take up her task, pray bring them here to me.

Yes, stoke the flame of your will to survive. To be victorious! Temper your soul in its heat!
The forge of my heart grows cold, and the world shivers for it.
Know this, Arisen: The world is merciless... Cold and empty, for all its beauty.
It is an ever-turning wheel, perfect beyond compare.
I stand at its center, as you may come to stand in turn.
It is my will that keeps it spinning. My will that urges time onward through eternity.
Our kind must fight, and through fighting prove the temper of our will.
It is a fight that knows no end...
It repeats upon itself, that all the world may repeat with it. And so the cycle continues, forever and ever and ever...
New-crowned sovereign and keeper of eternity, grant me now this single boon:
The fire of my life is spent and guttering. Give me freedom with the kiss of the Godsbane blade.
If there is aught you wish to know afore my death, you need but ask.
Question the Seneschal
Wield the Godsbane blade
Do nothing
My knowledge, as my all, is yours to take. What would you hear of me?
What is the Seneschal?
How is the world composed?
What is eternity?
What is will?
Nothing more.
The Seneschal is steward to the world... The world you traveled now rests in your care.
Just as the Arisen calls pawns into being and sets them to motion, the Seneschal holds dominion over all living things.
There are those who would call such a being Maker, or God.
I cannot deny the claim, any more than affirm it. In the end, they are but words.
Call it what you will, such is the office I have served, just as those before me and you beyond, unto eternity...
The pawns exist astride the rift. They speak of a multitude of worlds, each infinite unto itself.
Limitless in span and lost to time, these worlds extend in an eternal, perfect loop.
Just as a ring lacks start and end, so this world has no origin, no final terminus...
If it does, they lie beyond our ken.
We are prisoners of unpassing time, wandering an unending land. What lies beyond, we cannot know.
Aye, there is life in the world, and with it death. Naught lasts forever. Each rises and falls in its time.
But such is a death akin to that of pawns.
They appear in this world, then vanish only to appear again, like bubbles in a mountain spring.
As so it is with all that lives within this eternal world.
In time, you will come to see it happen under your watch as Seneschal.
Each beast, each blade of grass, each human life is born to die and be born again in endless rhythm.
Naught lasts forever, yet all persists unto eternity.
Will is that which led you to this place, and that which turns the eternal wheel of the world.
Along the endless string of life and death, there are some born with a hunger.
They yearn for some other, better place.
They are the Arisen, nascent fountainheads of will.
And so the dragon is sent into the world to guide the Arisen, and refine them. To temper their wills into aught capable of sustaining the world.
And so the cycle of our world has e'er continued.
As you wish, Seneschal. Yours is the will that drives the world, the axis 'round which it turns.
And turn it shall in perpetual peace, for as long as your will stands firm.
And ere the day your soul runs dry, parched in the endless act of creation, another shall arise.
The newly Arisen will walk their path and come to you, as you have come to me.
Until that day, I pray you will guide the world justly.
I am defeated, and in defeat my role is ended. Naught but an empty vessel remains.
Pray, vouchsafe freedom to your weary servant. Grant me the mercy of the Godsbane blade.

...I fear your crown outshines my own.
By my command:
Every road in Gransys shall be open to you henceforth
as a member of the Wyrm Hunt.
May your efforts help deliver us
from the shadow of the dragon.
As long as that damnable beast draws breath,<cf>I'll fain accept any help on offer.
For all her fearsome mien, Ophis keeps pets. Showers them with affection, no less.
Her favorite is a cyclops I've the misfortune of having to feed...
The dim beast always seems like to mistake me for its meal. 'Tis fearful work, it is!
I dearly wish someone else would take it up in my stead...
That cyclops won't eat unless it's goblin flesh. Finicky bastard, for a monster.
Are you the one, then? Who fed the cyclops for me? My thanks, friend.
You're quite something to have tamed the beast. Have you some magick to speak with their kind?
Well, I'll pass word on to Lady Ophis. She'll be pleased to hear of it, no doubt.
Mayhap you'll find aught in common as friends to beastkind, both.
Some whore's killed the cyclops Lady Ophis kept for a pet...
She's terrible wroth... Worse than I've ever seen. Best you let her alone for now.
This road leads to Gran Soren all right, but uh...
Apologies, ser -- you can't take this way just now.
You ask me, the Enlistment Corps is behind this devilry.
Corps is desperate for swords, see, but the townsfolk flee whenever their drums ring out. Nowhere to run now the road's closed, though, is there?
Ain't never seen a hydra head before! She's a right nasty piece of work.
I'd be clapped in irons and hung for sedition 'fore I'd square off against a monster like that.
You must have balls of solid iron!
You manage to get that hydra head back to Gran Soren? Imagine it gave them nobles quite a start.
You ask me, you should walk right up to His Grace and tell 'em what you done. It's a rare hero what can claim to best a hydra!
I wager the duke's young bride would be impressed with such a feat as well...
So you've gone and seen the duke already? Clever one, aren't you then.
Doing pretty well for yourself, aren't you? Forget the dragon -- you should pocket your coin and be off for a better life.
Well, that's what I'd do, anyway.
You ask me, you should just pretend to look for that dragon, eh?
Don't like to think what would happen if you actually found that scaly bugger. I wager he'd roast you to a cinder.
Th-the dragon's awakened? For true? Oh, this is a black day for us all...
Suppose I needn't worry overmuch, though. That dragon wouldn't stoop to bother some humble outpost guard the likes of me.
By the Maker, that sky... This...this is your doing, isn't it?
Not going to let on if you're behind all these goings-on then?
You ask me, I wouldn't neither.
Aim true!
Rrgh, 'tis too strong...
I'll not die...alone...
The way is closed, ser! The city is in chaos. None are to be admitted.
Come to join our flock, Arisen?
This! This is the answer, dear Arisen!　
Unto all things, death and chaos!
Yes, how may I aid you, ser?
Aye, we pay tariff on Fournival's land.
Oh! Wants us gone, does he? I wager it's not so simple a proposition as all that.
I know Fournival's the law on his side, but I'm loathe to simply up and go at his command.
It's a hard decision, ser, and not one I'd make alone.
I've a wife and son. They should get word of this afore all else.
They're off about the town, though where I don't know. Perhaps you could find them and explain the matter?
I would hear their thoughts ere I make any decision.
Hmm... As my family consents and expenses are covered, I've no cause to gainsay the decision.
Fie on Fournival for this. Someday he'll face the Maker and be made to stand for a host of ills.
He can purchase the land we trod, but I'll be hung and damned afore I give him favor.
Apologies, ser, but we'd be fools to abandon the land for such a pittance.
I'm poor, true, but not without sense. Though it may be my final act, I'll not accept such a deal. 
Hmm... If what you say is true, ser, I have my family's support.
However, something of the matter troubles me.
If we abandon our home to Fournival, he'll lend no support while we search for another.
Without funding, we've no way to secure new lodging, nor to live.
Might...you aid us, ser? I know it madness to ask such of the Arisen, yet I've nowhere else to turn.
<R_G>That it comes to this shames me beyond measure, but I pray you show us mercy.
Pay his moving expenses (<NOTE>30,000</NOTE>G)
Refuse
It seems my wife and child are as yet undecided.
I'll not press on without their consent.
We'll need to secure new lodging with all speed...
<R_G>Can you spare us any coin, ser, that we might not starve in the meantime?
Pay his moving expenses (<NOTE>30,000</NOTE>G)
Refuse
If you cannot aid us in this, ser, then we've no choice but to remain.
I'll not abandon the land, only to see my family perish from the elements.
Yes, how may I aid you, ser?
Aye, we pay tariff on Fournival's land.
Oh! Wants us gone, does he? I wager it's not so simple a proposition as all that.
I know Fournival's the law on his side, but I'm loathe to simply up and go at his command... 
B-beg pardon, ser! I'd not known my wife and child consented.
Well then, if my family has no objections... Yet one problem remains...
Without funding, we've no way to secure new lodging, nor to live.
Might...you aid us, ser? I know it madness to ask such of the Arisen, yet I've nowhere else to turn.
<R_G>That it comes to this shames me beyond measure, but I pray you show us mercy.
Pay his moving expenses (<NOTE>30,000</NOTE>G)
Refuse
Fournival was the very picture of a tyrant. But you, ser... You are a hero true.
I've little to offer, but I beg you accept this in tribute to your greatness.
These have been the hard days, but your kindness kept the worst at bay.
Are the rich truly so vain that the plight of common folk means naught to them?
What d'you make of this new plan the High Conclave's crafted? I know the aim's to sow chaos, but still... I can't but think it excessive.
Talk is, those walking bones have slain three of our own. And we're to let such creatures roam the roads?
Aye, I am bound for there now. 'Tis my first time...
I was surprised at the summons, truth be told. I've not been with Salvation long... I suppose they trust me.
I'll not miss the hellish life of a messenger, I'll tell you that.
Aye, I'll see it done. Worry not.
I shall see you at the next gathering, brother. Till dragonfire lights the dawn!
...What? I am in haste, ser. If you'll excuse me...
For months I've placed the key here as told, and only now do I stop to wonder if it is safe...
I suppose it isn't the sort of place a fellow would stumble upon without being told.
Either way, 'tis little concern of mine, now I'm bound for the Conclave hall.
Fare well.
Ngh.
Hnngh...
Aaaugh...
Yoh.
Toh!
Hoy! Well, I hope?
We'll speak again soon.
Aye.
No...
Thank you.
You've made a happy man of me, cos!
For me, cousin? Truly? Then I am happy to take it.
Truth be told, I'd happily take anything you saw fit to give.
Just know you're not like to get much in return from one odd as me, eh?
Walking about, cousin? With that wound? You're made of sturdier stuff than I, that's sure.
I know you had good cause, keeping the others safe, but I'd not thought you prone to such madness.
Are you certain you're well enough to...
But look at you, 'tis a plain thing to see you are hale as ever.
Still, let's have no more brave folly from you, eh?
That was a dragon, for true... The first in fifty years, they say.
For all the tales, I'd never thought it could truly be so massive.
There's a gloom about the village, still, since the beast struck. As if it left its shadow to menace us.
Seems it may be a while afore we're back out to sea, eh?
Standing about fretting never got a man anywhere. The only thing to do is do whate'er we can, each day after the next.
I'm ready to see where my tomorrow takes me.
Chosen to fight, have you, cos?
I long had a sense this day would come. When we would see you off...
Least I needn't worry about you. You were always an able hand at navigating rough waters.
Just see you don't forget this place will always be your home.
It may be the wyrm what has you setting out now...
But you go of your own free will. This is a journey of your choosing.
Walk proud, goodfisher, and trust in your heart.
I envy you your travels, cousin.
Cassardis is a pearl, mistake me not, but I've no intent of ending my days here.
The world holds too many mysteries. Too many new discoveries to make.
One day, I'll set sail myself, and learn the way of the world. It sounds half a jest, coming from me, but I speak it earnestly.
Gran Soren, eh? Seems a fine spot to drop anchor and center your travels around.
Though I'd think living under rule of the duke and his men would chafe.
I'm a freer sort than that, apt to go where the wind takes me, so I don't suppose the capital is for me.
You have your own matters to attend to -- I'll manage that matter myself.
I heard, cousin. Of the capital...
It beggars belief. I hope Cassardis will be spared such a fate.
Cassardis is a pearl, mistake me not, but I've no intent of ending my days here.
The world holds too many mysteries. Too many new discoveries to make.
One day, I'll set sail myself, and learn the way of the world. It sounds half a jest, coming from me, but I speak it earnestly.
There's aught I learned, after what you did...
I'd always thought you strong, goodfisher. Since we were but minnows.
But you're still human. You've no perfect will of unshakeable<cf>iron.
On that mountain, you weren't free of doubt. The choice you made was real, and painful, I doubt it not.
You knew you might die, like as not. You must have been scared, but you still chose.
I see now that to think you strong is to sell you short. You're--you're much greater.
You face each coming trial as best you're able, wrestle with it, and make your choice.
I am a lucky man indeed to share a bond with such as you.
Master!
Ngh.
Guagh!
Nraaaugh...
Hnh!
Hrunph!
Enjoying yourself, are you?
Then I'll be off.
Aye, I suppose.
No...
Mm, not bad at all.
I suppose I should thank you.
Mm?
Ah, the good Arisen. I thought I'd smelled something<cf>fishy about.
Oh, no, I didn't mean to suggest you were suspicious. Merely that a certain pungency, er...
My apologies. I meant no offense.
My own uncle, His Grace the duke was an Arisen in his day.
Far be it from House Dragonsbane to receive the Arisen with aught but hospitality.
Strange and shadowy folk have been milling about Gran Soren of late.
With the dragon upon us again, one simply cannot be too careful.
I trust you'll be mindful of the company you keep as well.
Still dallying, then? Forgotten outright? Well, I was a fool to have asked you in the first place...
Ah, Arisen.
Word has it you've been serving the duchy well. As well you ought!
Allow me to make one thing clear:
My uncle rose from the Arisen to his current seat, this much is true.
But he was born a knight.
You are welcome to give your all in service of the duchy, good Arisen.
But do not presume to rise above your station any more than you have.
It seems the dragon has awakened.
You'll be departing soon to slay it, I trust?
The songs tell of my uncle Edmun's battle with the beast.
They say he fought for three days and three nights without rest before emerging victorious.
I shall be very curious to see how long you last.
Fare well, good Arisen.
Enjoying yourself, are you?
I suppose I should thank you.
We may soon march on the dragon like this... I'm in no hurry.
Our tactic is sound. Keep at it!
Is that your worst!?

It doesn't look like you can read this section now.
There's more, but it doesn't look like you can read it now.
Now, choose. Stand against me,<cf>or speak your wish.<cf><cf>Offer your beloved in forfeit,<cf>and I shall see your will done.<cf><cf>Choose?

Who am I to stand as<cf>arbiter of two lives?<cf>...Of two loves.<cf>What would you have me do?<cf>You brought me here. You...<cf>If this be the will of the gods... The order<cf>of the world...

In memory of Grette,<cf><cf>Silent-hearted, dragonforged.<cf>With hair of gold and will of tempered steel.<cf><cf>You ransomed me from a village burnt to<cf>Ash--instilled life, and fight.<cf>Dearest mentor, I commend you now<cf>to rest eternal.<cf><cf>Your servant, bereft of master and memory,<cf>I keep now at my side.<cf>She lives on, your mirror in soul and body both,<cf>and I will not lose her as we have lost you.<cf><cf>This I swear before your empty grave.
"You have been chosen."<cf>So saying, the wyrm prised the heart from my breast.<cf><cf>I was made Arisen: known to the dragon, and bound<cf>to hunt it. It is a fate I embrace. What use have I<cf>for a heart left hollow?<cf><cf>In a world without sweet Grette--my mentor, my<cf>mother, my beloved...<cf><cf>I live only to see the dragon that claimed her<cf>slain. I will see its scaly hide stripped from<cf>bone by my hands ere I rest.
...Arisen. Bearer of the dragon's mark. Undying<cf>corpse, enjoined to make your will manifest.<cf><cf>If my voice reaches you, heed me well.<cf><cf>The Arisen, the Seneschal, the whole<cf>cursed world... All is but an illusion.<cf><cf>A meaningless refrain. A hollow echo...<cf>What sense is there in giving one's life<cf>for these falsehoods?<cf><cf>I damn them all.<cf><cf>And I will not cease in my destruction until<cf>the last senseless cycle is broken, the last<cf>bond rent to dust.
"I have wandered lost in this damnable maze<cf>for...it must be a year now, yet have found<cf>no hope of escape...<cf><cf>At times, a voice unknown to me seems to<cf>resound in the back of my mind, but my own<cf>daily fight for survival has left me with<cf>scant energy for pondering such mysteries...<cf><cf>From here on I shall strive to make a record<cf>of my journeys, if only in brief. Perhaps<cf>a journal of my thoughts might bring some<cf>small comfort--to me, or to any who would<cf>follow...                         —Arthacos"

"He lashed out at me like a wounded animal,<cf>malice clear in his bloodshot eyes. I<cf>finally managed to calm him, somehow, and he<cf>told me his tale.<cf><cf>He spoke of losing his heart to a dragon, so<cf>that he might avenge himself against the<cf>noble responsible for his daughter's<cf>death...<cf><cf>But when I suggested a union he would not<cf>hear of it. Instead he vanished back into<cf>the labyrinth's depths from which he came.<cf>I have not seen him since..."
"...a woman of scant few years. She said she<cf>was Arisen, too, and in search of armaments<cf>from some prophecy or legend.<cf><cf>She had a composure far beyond her years,<cf>and her manner gave me hope of fellowship.<cf>But she refused my invitation flatly,<cf>calling the duty hers to achieve alone.<cf><cf>Mayhap she had some fear of me? She, too,<cf>I have not seen or heard of since. Perhaps<cf>she found the items she sought? Or perhaps<cf>something else found her first."
"All the folk I have met in this labyrinth,<cf>without exception, are acquainted of a<cf>dragon. They are all Arisen.<cf><cf>'Tis curious indeed to meet so many with a<cf>destiny so like my own... Have we all been<cf>led here? Who would design -- or gain<cf>from -- such a ruse? What could await us at<cf>its end?<cf><cf>Questions I must ponder, but another day;<cf>I mustn't let it distract me from the task<cf>I have sworn to complete..."
"I am weary from toil and impatience both,<cf>and still the whispers continue...<cf><cf>I had steeled myself for a hard journey, but<cf>ne'er did I anticipate an ordeal such as<cf>this... One might think I'd grow accustomed<cf>to the isolation, having long since lost my<cf>attendant pawn, but it only grows harder to<cf>bear. There are riftstones here, but they<cf>are all broken, and I shan't expect to see<cf>them mended. Now my only companion is that<cf>strange voice..."
That voice... It speaks e'er within me,<cf>growing louder by the day, frustrating any<cf>attempt to ignore it. Even keeping hold of<cf>my own thoughts has become a struggle...<cf> <cf>Is this some omen of impending death?<cf>Clearly it is not the voice of my dragon<cf>steward...<cf><cf>Its monologue is incessant, its words clear<cf>and crisp, but I cannot grasp their meaning.<cf>Perhaps strangest of all is how little I'm<cf>bothered by hearing it of late..."
"Could this voice be attempting to instruct<cf>me how to proceed? Might it enlighten me<cf>about the darkness in which I've been<cf>sealed?<cf><cf>But I must not forget! I have a duty to<cf>perform. A duty... But what!?<cf><cf>Ah, 'tis impossible to gather my thoughts!<cf>What was the duty I pledged myself to? <cf>What was it that once I believed!?"
"...will record it here in case I should<cf>ever forget again: I am Arisen. 'Tis my duty<cf>sworn to bring everlasting peace to my<cf>homeland by making an offering of untainted<cf>souls -- one thousand human sacrifices --<cf>but as of yet I have fallen short of my<cf>obligation.<cf><cf>I swear again I will honor my promise to the<cf>dragon and receive its boon. I will locate<cf>and deliver the souls required, even in the<cf>depths of this dark place."
"I had only to listen...<cf><cf>What was once only fog is now as a spring<cf>day to my eyes...<cf><cf>What was once only noise, now as song to my<cf>ears...<cf><cf>It whispers the answers before I need even<cf>ask questions...<cf><cf>I must continue the sacrifices.<cf><cf>And so come the Arisen to this place, like<cf>salmon climbing down a great, dark stream...<cf><cf>They aid not in life, but in death...their<cf>blood fulfilling my promise and my duty...<cf><cf>...I had only to listen."
To serve her master, and be as she commands.<cf>To be shaped in her image. That is the part of<cf>a pawn. But my master's image is no longer<cf>her own. Defeated by the world-steward, she fell<cf>into perdition. Having witnessed her fail to<cf>achieve her purpose, my breast was filled with<cf>regret. Yet amid that darkness, a spark of light,<cf>too, took root. Within my soul, a crude and<cf>inchoate mirror to the Arisen's own, new strength<cf>emerged. I had awoken to love.<cf><cf>I came to notice the changes within me as his<cf>tireless ministrations saw my shattered memory<cf>slowly mend. I came to love him, as my master<cf>had before me. Then, some years later, fate came<cf>on dragon's wings to mark him an Arisen, as his<cf>master was before him. Though his heart was lost,<cf>he seemed more alive than ever. He burned with<cf>new purpose: to slay the wyrm and avenge Grette.<cf>I became his pawn of my own will. I, too, saw in<cf>this a new calling. To love him, serve him, and<cf>lend him strength. Ultimately, to become as him.<cf>It was a fate I welcomed gladly.<cf><cf>Defeat me, or speak your wish and offer up a<cf>sacrifice. A second time, I heard the dragon's<cf>bargain spoke. Yet I felt a strange reluctance<cf>in its tone. As if the ultimatum were given<cf>unwilling.<cf>And in that moment, I knew it.<cf>The wyrm we now faced was my former<cf>master transformed.<cf>The revelation tore him apart. Whichever his<cf>choice, the wages were cruel tragedy.<cf>A new and dark desire poured forth from his<cf>sundered soul. His wish for power to destroy<cf>all existence marked me for death.<cf>And yet I never blamed him.<cf>For as my life was snuffed out, I held firm to<cf>my belief. The day would come, I knew,<cf>when he, our master, and I myself would<cf>find redemption.
Still a child, I stood amid the ashes of<cf>my village. Through the driving rains two<cf>figures came. One, a woman of golden hair,<cf>extended me her hand, perhaps in pity.<cf><cf>Grette was the name she gave. A hunter of<cf>sorts, she said. Her quarry, the wyrm.<cf>As she spoke, the woman at her side simply<cf>stood and watched me, wordless. She was a pawn,<cf>come of a different world--the first I had seen.<cf>Her air was strange, yet somehow alluring.<cf><cf>I chose to join them, this Arisen and her pawn.<cf>It seemed that, or stand forever in the ruins of<cf>a lost life. They offered no words of invitation,<cf>yet neither did they turn me away as I followed.<cf>As we traveled, I was taught to fight.<cf>Grette was my mentor, my mother. She<cf>breathed new life into my parched soul.<cf>Then came the day the huntress found her<cf>mark. She left to face the wyrm...<cf>That day's parting proved final.<cf><cf>Her pawn returned, alone and scarce alive.<cf>Gone was the bold and faithful myrmidon who<cf>had served as Grette's steel. Her empty eyes<cf>stared through me now. And what of the wyrm?<cf>Had our mistress felled the beast and stayed<cf>calamity? The pawn held no answers, her mind<cf>and soul as broken as her body. Yet no more<cf>of the earth was swallowed up. No more was<cf>the sky stained black. It seemed the world had<cf>been ransomed. Or left, at least, to fester in the<cf>custody of humankind.<cf><cf>I was left with a single hope. A single wish.<cf>To bring back light to the deadened eyes of<cf>a masterless myrmidon. She was a pawn,<cf>I knew it well. Not human. Not of this land.<cf>And what of it?<cf>She bore Grette's mien. Her face. Will or nil,<cf>I soon found myself in love.
To know the unknown--that was my dream.<cf>To walk new frontiers and ancient halls<cf>alike, and to see all that this world holds.<cf>I was prepared to overcome any obstacle<cf>that barred my wandering.<cf><cf>And so, when the dragon plucked the heart<cf>from my breast, I knew only joy. With new<cf>power and ageless life, I was free.<cf>I knew no greater treasure than freedom.<cf>No higher virtue. And yet...<cf>What drove me, then, to take him with me?<cf>What ought have seemed a fetter became<cf>my greatest joy. My greatest love.<cf>And now... I haven't even the freedom of<cf>my own will. I followed the Arisen's path,<cf>past the wyrm and to the halls of the<cf>world-steward... And there, my path ended.<cf>In defeat, I was remade a dragon.<cf><cf>From the moment I donned a dragon's skin,<cf>I was controlled by a single, driving urge--<cf>To serve the Seneschal.<cf>This one thought consumed me, its pull<cf>inexorable. It was a hunger.<cf>An instinctual need.<cf>I burned for one who would defeat me.<cf>Who would succeed where I had fallen.<cf>I craved the new Arisen.<cf><cf>It is man's will that animates him.<cf>Can a being devoid of will truly be<cf>said to live? Am I alive, as I am now?<cf>The will that drives this cursed form to<cf>seek the Arisen is not my own.<cf>My will, my love, and all I am is crushed<cf>beneath its weight. Its force does not allow<cf>me even the luxury of regret.<cf>I am near drunk with it, though I war<cf>against it still with every shred of what<cf>once I was. In my final act as a thinking<cf>being, I chose him for my destroyer.<cf><cf>The question fell from my lips unbidden--<cf>What is your choice?<cf>Were it his wish, I would welcome death at<cf>his hands. Nay, I desired it.<cf>But his wavering gave voice to a new wish.<cf>That the world, its gods, and he himself<cf>be damned. My role was set.<cf>My actions bound.<cf>I existed in that moment solely to give<cf>his wishes form. And so I did.<cf>I answered his desire, his cry of despair...<cf>And his love, my former shadow, was the price.<cf><cf>My dreams have died, unfulfilled.<cf>Though I have neither the means to change that<cf>fact nor the free will to mourn them, perhaps...<cf>Perhaps what has transpired will serve some<cf>greater use. Let it be as a wedge struck into the<cf>chains that bind our endless, hollow world,<cf>that those to follow may shatter them.<cf>I failed in my quest to explore the unknown.<cf>But if it serve some use in ending this cruel<cf>cycle, I can believe my life held meaning.
A voice left in the void
The recollections of another Arisen
Olra's account
Ashe's account
Grette's account
...Leave me.
Begone, I say! I've naught to say to you.
My life is forfeit... And all because I o'erheard a secret whisper...
Ah, Maker... I pray my son is safe...
M-my permit!
Then my son...is safe? Maker be praised!
That such a fate could befall me... I never so much as considered it...
'Twas ill luck alone put me in this spot -- I but overheard a conversation.
I was attending to my duties as a royal aide and nobleman spoke nearby, yes...
But I knew them not, and gave their fervent whispers little attention...
Yet without warning, I found myself summoned by a guardsman.
He accused me of spying on the pair, and banished me to the dungeon forthwith.
I've lived the memory many times over in this place -- mostlike I could recall parts of the conversation if pressed...
But that means naught now. I seek only to save my life, or failing that, keep harm from my son.
Time is short. The Guard will return 'ere long, and begin their interrogation...
Mostlike they'll employ torture, which leaves my chances of survival pitifully low. 
I implore you, Arisen: Lead me from this terrible place!
You are my final hope. Save me, ser, I beg of you!
I've naught to say to you. Despair is my only companion now. 
Free one moment and criminal the next...
There can be no standing against such injustice. My life is forfeit afore the day is out.
I would give all to see my son but once more...
We must flee. If we are discovered, the horrors I'd endure would fall tenfold upon your head.
Hurry, Arisen!
Eegh!?
P-pardon, ser...
There... Did you hear that!? They're upon us!
Wait... Nay, 'tis only my nerves.
Beg pardon, Arisen. My selfishness has no doubt done your reputation harm.
Our attempt raised the ire of the guards, and even now they plan my death by the most painful means...
You've no reason to aid me anew, yet I cannot help but ask:
Please, Arisen. Return me to my son...
To think you would come for me again. Such chivalry is almost too much to bear.
I place my life in your hands once more, Arisen. Let us be off.
You must be mad, Arisen, to attempt my rescue anew.
The guards will surely not let me see another failed escape. Are you certain this is the wisest course of action?
In truth, I've little choice if I hope to see the sun again. Pray lead on, Arisen.
'Tis madness to attempt escape through the main gate...
We've escaped the castle.
Let's to the southern gate. Our pursuers dare not follow into the city proper.
We've not long now, Arisen!
Tomlin! My son, my son... What? How!?
Mere thanks seem nothing weighed against your actions, Arisen.
Without your aid, I would not stand afore you, nor seen my son again.
This whole ordeal has a foul air about it.
I fear the whispers I overheard are joined to sinister workings in the duchy.
Perhaps we shall learn what the talk concerned ere long. I only pray it causes us no further trouble.
I've naught with which to repay your kindness. But if ever you find yourself in need, only say the word and I'll be at your side.
Maker guide you until then, Arisen!
Mmm? The key to the door?
I wager the guard abandoned it somewhere, but for Maker's sake, take care! You'll join me here if you're caught!
Ah! Arisen!
Beg forgive me, ser!
Gyaaa!
'Twould be a fool's errand to leave by the main gate.
Long ago, a former prisoner swore me that his escape was made by way of a secret path...
A passage told only by the howl of the wind, or so the story went.
Let's make for this hidden route, Arisen. I warrant little chance is better than none at all. 
You were gone in the blink of an eye, ser. I knew not what to do, save come back here... I've little time left, ser. Let us go.
I can ill return to my old post, I fear, but I'll find some way to live.

A child of man, bound to the dragon.
Well met, young Arisen.<cf>I am he who was forged by the dragon.
Krgh.
Gaugh!
Gaaah...
Hnh!
Rraagh!
Mm? Ah...
I must away.
Aye.
Not so.
Kind of you.
I thank you.
If you've aught to ask, ask it of Captain Mercedes.
I've no love for idle chatter. If you'll excuse me.
Truth be told, I'd placed little stock in tales of the Arisen.
Might be there's something to it after all.
Forgive me my candor. I fear I was born blunt as a cudgel, and so I've ever been.
Seems to me there's aught to the Arisen beyond simple strength.
...Not that it be any concern of a sellsword such as I.
Ser Mercedes is given to thinking overmuch.
Live, and you've won. Die, and you've lost. That's all there is to know of war.
Take pride in your victory.
The weak e'er fall to the strong. 'Tis the way of war.
There's naught to gain in gnashing your teeth now.
I thank you.
Oh! I... I didn't expect to find you here.
Though in truth, you could well say the same of me.
I'm sorry, I... I know I cause you worry...
But I've glad tidings: At long last I'm granted leave to the Grand Cathedral. 
Thoughts of your plight consumes my days, but now I may finally discover some means to aid you.
All the Faith knows of the dragon can be found at the Grand Cathedral. I... I pray you support my decision to go.
I do.
I do not.
Thank you.
I feel I must go...both for your sake and my own.
In my heart of hearts, I always knew you would support me. 
Is that not why you help Sister Clarus gather items for a blessing?
Yes, I heard. But please, do not let slip that I know. She does so love her little surprises.
I do wish you would stay close.
Shall we?
Truly...?
If you feel so, why help Sister Clarus hunt items for my journey?
Don't look so dumbfounded. You never were skilled at hiding things away from me.
All my days, whatever my troubles, you were ever quick to offer me aid... I seek only to do the same.
I'd best be off -- I've preparations to make ere I depart. Until we meet at the abbey, then.
You make me feel quite small, Sister.
To quit the abbey for my own reasons seems altogether selfish now.
Oh, my...
So this is why you spent such long hours afield...
It is...wonderful. I cannot imagine the effort it took to craft.
My steps will be lighter knowing I bear the support of such fine friends.
Pray, wait for me... I shall return to help as soon as I might.
Also, I...I would give you this.
It is a small thing, hardly equal to all you've done for me, but I...
Listen to me. It seems there's nary a parting I can't turn painful.
I shall return to you. I swear it.
So this is why you spent such long hours afield...
It is...wonderful. I cannot imagine the effort it took to craft.
My steps will be lighter knowing I bear the support of such fine friends.
Pray remember, I seek only to aid you as you have so oft done for me.
I will return with the knowledge you need to dispatch the wyrm, just wait.
Also, I...I would give you this.
It is a small thing, hardly equal to all you've done for me, but I...
Listen to me. It seems there's nary a parting I can't turn painful.
I shall return to you. I swear it.
What? The expense of such a... Your kindness is too much to bear.
Thank you. I love it. Truly.
My steps will be lighter knowing I bear the support of such fine friends.
I have something for you as well. It seems meager measured against your gift, but...I...
Listen to me. It seems there's nary a parting I can't turn painful.
I shall return to you. I swear it.
I shall see you at the abbey anon. Maker speed your steps.
...I sense someone nearby.
The scent of beasts is thin here. We<cf>should be comparatively safe.
I feel a strange sense of ease here.
Scather
Medicant
Mitigator
Challenger
Utilitarian
Guardian
Nexus
Pioneer
Acquisitor
Guh!
Hnngh!
Wauuugh...
Huh!
Yaah!
Aye...?
Go, then.
Aye.
No.
Thank you.
Such kindness, for one such as me... I thank you.
If the castle falls to the dragon, I'm as good as buried alive...
Why am I here? Your reckoning is as sound as my own.
...You probably find it no surprise that a man locked in the dungeons pleads his own innocence. But at the very least I wish the chance to prove my case.
Do not take lightly the ideals of truth and justice. For in this place, they are nowhere to be found.
And that itself is the greatest punishment for the weak.
Then Fournival was convicted? I see...
'Tis the case of a man what dug his own grave, I suppose.
Still, the whole matter leaves a bitter taste in my mouth.
What? Acquitted? Fournival was found innocent?
...Then there is no place in this world for truth.
The law is but a straw man, fit to scare off crows. A frightening thought indeed...
I am in your debt, ser.
I can ill return to my old post, I fear, but I'll find some way to live.
'Twas carelessness bought me my fate before. I'll learn from my mistake.
I need to be strong, for my son's sake as much as my own.
To look upon that hole, there's no meaning left in talk of truth and justice.
I've given up... Given up hope, I suppose.
Such kindness, for one such as me... I thank you.
'Tis locked. You haven't the key to fit it...
'Tis caught on something. Perhaps it could open from the far side.
'Tis barred shut. Might be able to break the bolt.
'Tis shut tight.
'Tis no use at this hour. You'll have to come again later.
Best stop for now.
Seems they're closed.
Someone was here...
Lost them...
Gone...
Perhaps you've upset them.
There's naught to do here.
Best you moved on.
Not here...
The door is closed.
Shows no sign of opening.
There's aught there...
You don't see anything.
That smell...
Someone's near...
What's this...?
Fine view from here.
There's aught written here...
Must be a way to find something...
Smells delicious.
Perfect spot to place something.
You can almost reach...
There appears to be aught ahead.
That fall could kill.
'Tis dangerous to touch.
A strong blow might break it.
Perhaps if you came by night.
Perhaps if you came by day.
Perhaps if you came at dawn.
Perhaps if you came at dusk.
There's aught buried here...
You see no way up.
'Tis slick, this spot.
No use pressing any further.
No need to double back further.
No time for that now.
You cannot carry any more.
There may yet be aught lying about.
Seems there's naught you can take on at present.<cf>Best to try again later.
Perhaps with a bit of help...
Best you kept your weapon sheathed.
Is someone here...?
'Tis a place for tall folk.
'Tis a place for small folk.
Had you a woman in your band...
Had you a man in your band...
Had you a strong companion...
Had you a swift companion...
Had you a magick user...
Had you an apt climber...
Had you a skilled jumper...
This weapon will not help you.
That armor won't protect you.
You're ill equipped for this.
Seems it can't be used now.
You'll get no further use from it.
'Tis useless, now.
Hmm, not with your current equipment...
Not with your current party...
You hear aught from further in.
Enemies... They're close.
Best you got some rest.
You can carry no more!
You're too exhausted!
"Danger! Keep Out!"
"No Trespassing"
A sign.
Had you an Empty Flask, you might fill it here.
You'll get no further without a lantern.
'Tis dangerous to fumble about in the dark. Best find a light.
Best not just leave them.
If aught were left here, it would rot.
Best take care you don't get lost.
Best check the map.
You're due for a rest.
This place is dangerous by night.
This place is dangerous by day.
Breathtaking...
You'll get no further!
Seems you'll need to come back.
Nothing left here.
It looks fit to crumble.
Seems it could be moved...
It will not budge.
It will not open.
Seems you need a key.
Seems you need a Pickaxe here.
You yet lack the experience.
You yet lack the skill.
Not with your current vocation...
You'll not pass through this gate.
You've no time!
Seems you were too late.
You may make it, yet.
You're doing well for time.
Seems you've come at the wrong time.
There may be another path.
'Tis a powerful weapon... Too bad it doesn't work.
Something strong can be sensed from the stone. It <cf>appears the memories of someone have been etched<cf>upon the surface of the Monument of Remembrance.
'Tis hard to find reason to go on.
Perhaps we're being punished for some ill we've wrought...
A man needs see to his own safety.
Everyone's desperate just to weather the storm.
'Tis a mercy there's work to be found, given the times.
Consider... The infinite potential...
Just as you call forth pawns,
so I command all life into existence.
Call it divine creation if you must.
But expect none of the mercy men seek in their gods.
This is cold truth.
The unbending reality of a world without compassion.
The world and all its denizens are but empty vessels.
In that regard, no different than the pawns...
Without volition, there is no true life.
The world falls stagnant,
dead as an ocean with no current to guide it.
That volition is tempered by the struggle for survival.
The decision, just like yours, to fight.
Just as the pawns need a master's command,
so the world thirsts for the will to live.
Eeeagh!
It is the end...
Make haste!
The careless who enter the Everfall rarely return.<cf>Let's prepare well.
This place is the link twixt this world and the next.<cf>We walk in death's shadow, Arisen.
Our task is completed. Let us return.
We are returned safe... Though 'tis not the last we'll<cf>see of that place, like as not.
'Tis regrettable. Next time, surely...
Visibility is poor... Stay on guard.
Who knows what lies in wait? Best<cf>proceed with caution.
That's the capital, on the far bank...
Gran Soren is ever quite the sight.
This road leads to the capital.
Follow this road north and we'll hit<cf>Gran Soren.
We need but take this road north to<cf>find Gran Soren.
We'll likely face ambush here. Stay<cf>watchful.
'Tis massive... And it blinds us to<cf>what lies beyond.
The stone makes a regrettably<cf>effective wall...
Cassardis looks so small from here...
See there? Cassardis. We've come far...
'Tis difficult to walk such a narrow<cf>path.
'Tis an unwieldy place to fight...
Take care you don't fall.
The footing here is poor. Tread<cf>carefully.
Should you fall, 'twould be quite a<cf>climb back...
Care to find out where this path leads?
This isn't the way to the capital. I<cf>wonder where it leads...
A river... I doubt we can cross it.
I hear running water...a river?
I wonder where this river flows?
Quite the cascade... I'd not like to<cf>attempt that fall.
Best we keep our distance...
That river must lead to the sea.
These falls are so large, we could<cf>easily pass behind them.
Who'd have thought to find such a<cf>place?
A cave entrance hides behind the falls.
These appear to be some kind of ruins.
'Tis uneven footing. Watch your step!
What sort of place is Gran Soren? I<cf>am eager to see it.
We shall soon arrive at Gran Soren,<cf>Master.
With so many twists, it's hard to<cf>see what lies ahead.
Never forget -- constant vigilance!
Looks like a cottage.
Shall we jump? It might shorten our<cf>path. ...Or our lives.
Monsters...? Or bandits, else?
What could they have been<cf>transporting?
Whoever did this may still be near...
Keep an eye turned to the shadows...
'Twas not the safest of paths, but we<cf>made it nonetheless.
This is the entrance... What a grand<cf>city!
Arrived at long last. 'Twas a hard road.
Gran Soren, at last. Come, let's enter!
Castle walls? Or the ruins of such?
Stay watchful. Something could lurk<cf>nearby.
We could be ambushed... Stay alert!
Quite the view, eh?
The lea is vast... 'Twould be easy<cf>to get lost.
There's certainly no worry of ambush<cf>out here.
'Tis well ancient, this bridge. I<cf>hope it still holds.
This must have been built ages ago.
Seems a place ripe for ambush...
Trouble may lie in wait here...best<cf>be ready for anything.
Stay alert...we may not be alone.
I hear aught moving about the wood...
There -- movement, in the woods...<cf>Beasts...or monsters, else.
This seems to lead underground.
This leads down into the catacombs.
Such large stones... This must be a<cf>quarry.
Seems we've found the quarry.
There may be aught of use inside.
Up there. A stronghold...?<cf>'Tis awfully high up...
Best we give that place a wide berth.
Take care you don't lose your footing.
The very terrain seems eager to keep<cf>us from the hold...
'Tis an imposing sight from so close.
By the looks of it, 'tis a grand and<cf>sturdy fortress.
The trees here have a different look<cf>than those of the south.
There, a cave entrance.
I see the hold.
We've arrived at the duke's northern<cf>stronghold.
There's something drawn on the hill...
This place is known as Hillfigure<cf>Knoll.
Tis a queer formation of rocks.
Were they placed here by men? For<cf>some ritual, perhaps?
We've come quite a ways from<cf>Cassardis!
There's a structure ahead.
What manner of place could that be?<cf>'Twas obviously once a grand building.
A tent, here? Is anyone inside?
Look at the size of it... What could<cf>lie within such a tower?
A watchtower, perhaps?<cf>But watching over what?
One could see all of Gransys from<cf>atop that.
'Tis even larger up close.
This looks nothing like where we<cf>were before...
Seems this place has never been<cf>touched by man...
Such a lonely place...
Take care when walking at the<cf>water's edge.
The water may be home to hidden<cf>threats.
Beasts dwell in water. Best we<cf>remain cautious.
Quite a number of tents... No sign<cf>of people, though.
Perhaps we might use one of those<cf>tents...
This hardly looks effective enough<cf>to ward off monsters.
The marsh grows deep at its center,<cf>I should think. We'd best go around.
Shall we press on? We can turn back<cf>if it proves too deep.
That structure before us is the<cf>Greatwall.
If we're to travel by land, then<cf>we've no choice but to go around.
'Tis a grander structure than the<cf>other holds we've seen.
This fortress is meant to protect Gransys<cf>from the dragon... It does look very solid.
This open space is a welcome change<cf>from those narrow roads.
'Tis a relief to need not fear an<cf>ambush.
Look, there's a stronghold of some<cf>sort by the sea.
A stronghold, here? What could it be<cf>meant to defend?
That hold's a home to thieves, now.
We've no cause to get too close,<cf>Master, and plenty of reasons not to.
There may be monsters about.
The shadows crawl with fiends. Stay<cf>watchful.
Stay alert.
We'd best not chance any closer than<cf>this...
Tis an impressive structure.
I see no lookout.
Bandits aren't fond of intruders. If<cf>they see us, they'll attack.
What an incredible view.
I wonder what lies beyond the horizon?<cf>I hope we can find out someday, Master.
I cannot see another shore... Do you<cf>suppose the sea continues into eternity?
Watch your footing, Master.
One slip and it's a long fall down...
Quite a breathtaking view from here.
Mm, feel that breeze...
Lovely view. Be lovelier still,<cf>without the monsters.
A tent.
Seems it was abandoned here.
Quite the eccentric what set up camp<cf>out here...
Looks abandoned.
Seems it's been awhile since anyone<cf>has called this place home.
What a large tree.
It seems to stand watch over the<cf>wood...
There's a lake ahead.
The water draws some beasts near.<cf>Stay sharp.
You don't see trees like this elsewhere.
We'd best be cautious, Master.
The wood grows thicker.
Be it monsters or beasts of the wood,<cf>there is plenty of reason to stay wary.
'Tis clammy and dank... Let us be<cf>quit of this place, Master.
'Tis safest on the roads.
Stray from the roads and we'll soon<cf>find monsters, Arisen.
Birds oft nest atop tall trees.
The rocks here may hold ore.
'Twould be simple enough to descend,<cf>though I can't say the same for returning.
The land here is meager, unfit to<cf>sustain trees.
The soil here is unique. We may find<cf>aught new to harvest from it.
Mind the wind, Arisen.
The winds here are strong, though<cf>they ease as one climbs higher.
What do you make of this, Master?<cf>Shall we enter?
This spring will ease our weariness.
There's little sign of looting. Perhaps<cf>the winds have kept thieves at bay.
Take extra care on these narrow<cf>paths... They could be booby trapped.
How deep do you suppose it is?
'Tis the rear of the duke's manse.
'Tis Ser Daerio holds the key to this<cf>door.
A trap, down below!
'Tis your hometown, is it not, Arisen?
The Corps uses this place to gather<cf>new soldiers and train them in combat.
Gran Soren stands beyond this<cf>waycastle.
So this is the capital. 'Tis vast...
Gran Soren, the beating heart of all<cf>Gransys.
An abbey, here? It seems a dangerous<cf>place for such pursuits.
Seems this place is dogged by thieves.
A band of thieves make their den not<cf>far from here.
Bandits, Master. Pray, be careful.
Pray, do not provoke them, Arisen!<cf>Let's first find their leader.
Talk is, a band of woman thieves<cf>makes their den in these parts.
Thieves or no, we've naught to gain<cf>from unnecessary combat.
I fear we're not like to get far<cf>speaking with their leader.
Their leader infamously abhors men. Were<cf>we all female, she'd like speak with us.
I hear a lack of supplies has weakened<cf>the duke's defenses in the north.
Gran Soren guards, so far from the<cf>capital?
The lack of supplies has damaged<cf>morale among the men as well.
The Greatwall... 'Twas built to keep<cf>all manner of beasts from Gransys.
'Tis known as the Shadow Fort, built<cf>to ward against a goblin invasion.
What purpose do you suppose those<cf>men's post serves?
Holds like this one are crucial in<cf>warding the capital from monsters.
With Gran Soren as a base, we ought<cf>to be able to travel even further.
Be they swordsman or scholar, the duke<cf>has mobilized all men to face the wyrm.
I've come to feel more at peace when<cf>the capital is in sight.
I worry for the sisters' safety.
Seems there's more than one way to<cf>deal with bandits.
Seems the duke aims to ring all<cf>Gransys with strongholds...
The best men in the strongest hold are<cf>powerless without supplies to live on.
Even the dragon's coming is not<cf>enough to unite men's hearts as one.
'Tis a heavy onus the men here bear.
This passage links south and central<cf>Gransys.
The duke could stand to commission<cf>some new roads...
They breed like rabbits, these goblins...
They say in times long past such<cf>hillfigures were not uncommon.
The figure bears the mark of an Arisen.<cf>Perhaps it was meant as a sign for you?
Perhaps the figure serves as a beacon,<cf>to bring people of a kind together.
A tower, standing in such remotes?
'Tis the Bluemoon Tower, said to have<cf>stood here since time immemorial.
Mankind does love to build towers. 'Tis like<cf>they pursue their Maker's own vantage...
Seems there's a path atop the hill as<cf>well.
This road offers a fine view of the area.
What a queer odor...
The waters of this marsh are suffused<cf>with fetor.
The site of an attack... The victim's<cf>belongings have been scattered about.
This cold is a far cry from<cf>Cassardis' clime, no doubt.
Only evergreens grow in this cold.<cf>Perhaps we might harvest aught from them?
A fall from here may not hurt, but 'tis<cf>best to tread carefully just the same.
The road here has a strange look to<cf>it, does it not?
This stretch was once a river, ere it<cf>went dry.
Tis evidence this place was once<cf>well-traveled.
'Tis a queer growl comes from<cf>beyond the paling...
If this path poses too great a risk, we<cf>might just as easily walk down below.
'Tis hard not to feel small in a<cf>chamber built to a cyclops's scale.
If you were of a mind to climb it, it<cf>may well be possible...
We could scale this slope, provided<cf>we sought out the shallowest slopes.
Must we pass through that forsaken<cf>bog again on our return?
The fetor that corrupts this place at least<cf>offers unique materials for harvest.
With a running start, we can reach<cf>the far side.
Signs of a camp, out here...?
Have you noticed the fireflies neutralize<cf>the poison of the marsh by night?
'Twould be a grand place for sight-<cf>seeing, were it not for the monsters.
A waterfall... Mind the depth of the<cf>water, Arisen.
The pass is treacherous, Master.<cf>Watch your head.
A cottage... Seems long abandoned.
A deserted cottage. Let's see if<cf>there's aught of use within.
'Tis treacherously steep...
Do you suppose it was nature gave<cf>these stones their shape, or aught else?
Such open areas are two-edged swords.<cf>Every monster for leagues can see us.
The sea is closer than I'd imagined.
An imposing structure afore it fell,<cf>I'm sure.
A long-fallen waycastle, this. Still,<cf>there may yet be aught atop the wall.
Seems fairly shallow.
These waters like see a fair number<cf>of items swept here from upstream.
I'll warrant this was a proud wall, once.<cf>Perhaps there's aught nearby yet.
We'll find a vantage to fire down on<cf>our foes from atop the wall.
Table scraps, perhaps? From a giant<cf>bird, looks like.
This is a fine place to lie in<cf>ambush, Arisen.
Watch for a goblin ambush ahead,<cf>Arisen.
Bandits can strike in the blink of an<cf>eye in places like this.
We must take care the pass does not<cf>claim us as its next victims.
Is there truly no easier way to cross<cf>this mountain?
Old texts claim the roads twixt Gran Soren<cf>and Cassardis were once well-traveled.
A fine castle, that. 'Tis nearly a<cf>fortress.
The duke's burden is great, between his<cf>duties as sovereign and the Wyrm Hunt.
Even the capital is not without its<cf>dangers. Best we remained cautious.
Plants of all kinds grow at the tree's<cf>feet like so many verdant children.
Roots of this sort of tree oft yield<cf>useful herbs and other plants.
Look -- those tracks! It seems there's<cf>more than monsters living in this wood.
I hear animals nearby. Meat would be<cf>a welcome addition to our provisions.
We can likely pass through here.
Let's have a look at that rise in the<cf>land. There may be aught to harvest.
There's a path here at the water's edge.
Seems we can walk beyond the shore<cf>here. Perhaps we'll find aught of use.
These crags offer poor visibility...
Perhaps we'll find ore among the<cf>crags that litter this place.
Have you found aught?
There may be materials here. Perhaps<cf>we'll find aught of use.
The view extends for leagues along<cf>the shore.
We can see monsters for leagues on<cf>the open shore. And they us, in turn...
Beasts behave differently by day and<cf>by night. They may be more apt to<cf>attack at certain times.
We share these roads with traveling<cf>peddlers, guardsmen, and other folk.
The villagers will be joyed to see<cf>you home again, Arisen.
Well sturdy, this place...
Built to keep out goblins, I should<cf>think.
This encampment serves as a fine<cf>bulwark against monsters.
I daresay this road scarce sees<cf>civilian use.
I pray the day monsters no longer<cf>haunt the roads is not far off.
We're apt to meet bandits and thieves<cf>as oft as peddlers, Master. Be watchful.
Seems deserted... Perhaps there's<cf>aught left we might have use of.
The structure is abandoned, Arisen.<cf>Let's have a look for supplies within.
Where visibility is poor, we must be<cf>especially wary of attacks.
'Tis a land rife with spots where<cf>useful materials may hide.
We're like to find a bountiful harvest tucked<cf>in among all these nooks and crannies.
What a drop... 'Tis like the open space<cf>is about to reach out and take you.
Tis certain death to fall from such a<cf>height.
The grade is steep, Master. Mind you<cf>don't slip.
Tis easy to slip on an incline this<cf>steep, Master. Watch your step.
The terrain is wild and varied here.<cf>We'd best choose our path carefully.
The lay of the land defies<cf>conventional travel.
The path diverges...
The road splits. Let's be doubly sure of<cf>which will see us to our destination.
This path runs the canyon floor...<cf>We'll need to stay wary.
The canyon floor is an apt spot to find<cf>ourselves surrounded. We'd best be careful.
Quite the grand structure. ...A<cf>waycastle, perhaps?
'Tis lined with driftwood and<cf>river-worn stones.
Seems we're well downstream. Perhaps<cf>aught of interest has washed up.
A cave extends beyond. Best we were<cf>well prepared afore entering.
'Tis a steep grade. Doubly so with<cf>aught in hand.
'Tis dangerous to walk the cliff's edge.
Keep watch for falling rocks as we<cf>walk the slopes, Master.
'Tis a cage built to hold a human,<cf>Master. Is anyone inside?
We're still a fair ways from the<cf>nearest settlement.
The path splits... Best we had a look<cf>at our map.
We've come far enough we needn't fret<cf>about losing our way, mm?
'Tis most unsettling... Best we chose<cf>our path carefully.
We're far from civilization yet.
We're near half between the<cf>encampment and the capital, I'd warrant.
Just how far will our journeys take<cf>us, I wonder?
What evil does this sense of<cf>foreboding portend?
This hold is home to thieves, now.
Our search would go much easier,<cf>were we able to use this gate...
'Tis a lever up above controls the<cf>gate.
Soldiers sent from the capital<cf>watch over this hold.
'Tis an irony Salvation's schemes have<cf>only drawn the wyrm and Arisen closer.
The walls bear heavy scars... I fear<cf>'tis too late now to mend them.
A former Arisen makes his home not<cf>far from here.
The heart of that grand figure may<cf>hold some secret...
The hill bears the likeness of a<cf>warrior who arose against the wyrm.
Stay vigilant, Master. 'Tis said a<cf>band of thieves prowls this region.
Keep watch for the catacombs. We<cf>should be near upon them.
'Tis a far different clime from the<cf>capital. Perhaps it bears novel fruit.
'Twould be a small wonder to find<cf>anything within such a labyrinth...
Cast a monster down below and it<cf>won't soon return.
A dead end... Though it seems a hold<cf>stands above us.
If we would ford the river, let us<cf>make haste, lest the Brine take us.
We near the beasts' nest. Tread<cf>softly.
Now, what's this doing here?
Look over there. Is that...some<cf>sort of structure?
There, a tower in the distance. What<cf>says the map, Arisen?
I'd not thought to find such a place<cf>here.
One never knows what such forgotten<cf>corners may hold.
A boat...?
It must have washed up here...<cf>Perhaps it still holds cargo.
The roads are safer than the brush,<cf>but still we'd best stay wary.
Seems all roads lead to Gran Soren.
Tracks, Master. Monsters, most like.
Monsters can strike day or night, even<cf>in the shadow of Gran Soren's walls.
'Twas most like a watchpost, once.
'Twas once a place under heavy watch.<cf>Best we were no less vigilant now.
'Tis so difficult to see... How<cf>much longer will this continue?
Stay wary, Master. Visibility is poor<cf>ahead.
Seems people lived here, once...
War has not been kind to this place.
There are tools scattered about...<cf>Miners' kit, from the look of it.
Years of mining has given this place<cf>a rich store of footholds.
There are stones here in all manner of<cf>curious shapes and sizes...
Cullings from the quarry. Perhaps the<cf>land still holds aught of worth.
Best we did not stray too far from the<cf>capital.
Stay watchful, Master. The darkness<cf>has us at a disadvantage.
Those walls must be a great comfort to<cf>those who dwell within.
The city holds every amenity. 'Twould<cf>make a fine base for our adventuring.
Whither next, Master?
Before setting off, we ought equip<cf>ourselves to suit our objectives.
The crags cast shadows fit to hide all<cf>manner of evil. Stay ready.
The crags care not whom they hide.<cf>Better it be us.
You can see for leagues.
We're easily spotted out on the open<cf>plains.
...Running water? Sounds close.
I hear water nearby. We're like to<cf>find monsters at its edge.
We'd best bring a lantern if we aim to<cf>pass this way by night.
A lantern will draw attention out<cf>here. Stay watchful.
A wharf... Abandoned, now.
An anchorage... Mayhap there's still<cf>aught here we might use.
There are rocks in the river.<cf>If only we could get to them...
Perhaps the rocks hide trinkets swept<cf>downstream.
It looks well deep, Master. Be<cf>careful.
Beware the water's edge, Master!<cf>Monsters lurk within the depths.
This scenery's quite a change.
Given the look of things, we'd best be<cf>well prepared afore pressing on.
Those rocks jut out of the river.
We can like ford the river across<cf>these stones.
'Tis said a treasure exists could<cf>whisk us even from here in an instant.
One cannot be too careful at the<cf>water's edge.
Let's seek out the shallows, lest we<cf>lure the Brine...
A bridge... 'Twill serve as a fine<cf>landmark.
Cast an eye below as we cross. There<cf>may be aught beneath the bridge.
Cross here and we're apt to emerge<cf>soaked to the bone.
If we keep to the shallows, we needn't<cf>get soaked through.
'Twas monsters left these scars.
The scene of an attack, most like.<cf>Perhaps there's aught to be scavenged.
All this open space spurs the desire<cf>to run, aimless and free.
It falls on us to pace ourselves on<cf>roads so open.
Here near the capital, it must be safe.
Even a stone's throw from the<cf>capital, nighttime holds danger.
'Tis difficult to judge distance when<cf>facing foes across such open plains.
Ranged attacks serve well in wide open<cf>spaces.
The ground bears tracks... A wild<cf>animal of some sort?
Hmm, nothing to see for leagues.
If there's naught to see here, let's<cf>press on.
Danger stalks even the city streets.<cf>Best we remained well-equipped.
This quarry once bustled with miners<cf>about their business...
An abbey lies at the heart of these<cf>withered woods.
'Tis weary work, standing guard in<cf>hostile lands. Morale can falter...
Be well careful should we come upon a<cf>giant four-legged beast in the woods.
Monsters prowl land and sky alike.<cf>Take care you're not caught unawares.
Fell an ox and we'll have ample store<cf>of meat for an emergency.
This land's seen many a clash 'tween<cf>man and monster o'er the years.
The wyrm's coming has driven beasts<cf>to flood in from the mountains.
The battle ever rages on... Only the<cf>Arisen can sever the endless chain.
A word of advice, Master: Choose your<cf>companions carefully.
Each different combination of allies<cf>offers its own tactics for battle.
No single strategy will serve every<cf>encounter. One must adapt.
If victory is elusive, seek new allies.<cf>Where that fails, seek new foes.
Endeavor to be ever calm in battle.<cf>Bide your time, then strike.
A craftsman must know his tools, a<cf>warrior his weapons.
Every beast has its weakness. Observe<cf>closely, and learn to exploit it.
With practice, precision strikes and<cf>enchantment use will become routine.
Weapons, armor, skills... There are<cf>endless combinations to try out.
A good start to any task is talking<cf>with others. Let's begin with that.
Idle too long, and the sun may<cf>set on our errand. Be wary.
Arisen, your actions may well alter<cf>the path to completing a quest.
'Tis not uncommon for missions to<cf>affect each other in various ways.
Some quests may require difficult<cf>choices. Be ready for anything.
'Tis a fair drop, and likely a fatal one.
Mind the edge, Master. Even you<cf>wouldn't survive such a fall.
A formidable stretch of terrain...<cf>How shall we proceed?
If we tread carefully, I'm certain<cf>a way forward will present itself.
I sense something nearby...<cf>A bird, perhaps...or...bigger.
This is harpy territory. Keep watch<cf>on the skies.
Were we not just here? All<cf>these paths look the same...
Fear not should we lose our way,<cf>Master. Your map will serve us.
How dark it is! I can't see a thing.
Perhaps a lantern might help us<cf>find the way...
It's dark...<cf>Where are we to go from here?
There must be a ladder nearby. Let's<cf>draw a lantern and have a look.
Hm... We might find aught of use<cf>here, Master. I suggest we search.
Hm... We might find aught of use<cf>here, Master. I suggest we search.
Small caves such as this oft<cf>hold items of some use.
'Twould seem the monsters take new<cf>ground as a means of survival.
Goblin packs are ruled by the strong.
Even the feeble foes are formidable<cf>when attacking en masse.
Slipping and falling to one's death<cf>is no idle fear around here.
I reckon if we caught a harpy,<cf>it could ferry us across.
...What is this place?
Appears someone lives here. Perhaps<cf>we might find supplies.
A tent... Abandoned by some<cf>traveler, perhaps.
Monsters may nest in empty tents,<cf>Master. Beware.
Harpies favor rocky tracts such<cf>as these.
The beasts of these parts are proving<cf>a greater challenge, to be sure.
In lands where men fear to dwell,<cf>monsters always fill the void.
Yet there is much to find in these<cf>unexplored lands, Master.
The climate is certainly pleasant<cf>in southern Gransys.
Rare items may have washed up along<cf>the shoreline. Let's take a look.
This place... I cannot help but re-<cf>call that fateful day in Cassardis...
'Tis a far cry from the roads we're<cf>accustomed to, that's for certain...
These woods see few visitors, hence<cf>all the monsters and rare materials.
I feel we do not belong here. These<cf>woods are like a different world.
Nature is unbridled here. 'Tis<cf>quite a pleasant corner.
What a splendid woodland, and so rich<cf>in resources.
Seems this road doesn't get much use.
The monsters that lurk here keep<cf>this path all but deserted. 
I spy tracks... Wolves, perhaps,<cf>or wild dogs.
Proceed with caution, Master. There<cf>may be wolves about.
Ah, animal dung... A deer, perhaps?
This is deer country. If you've a<cf>taste for venison, we should hunt.
These are human footprints...<cf>doubtful it was a friendly one.
Be wary of anyone we encounter<cf>out here. Trust no one.
Look at these... Goblin tracks.<cf>They are troublesome in groups.
Stay on your guard, Master. We<cf>journey through goblin territory.
A cage... And of sufficient size<cf>to confine a person.
All these feathers about... No<cf>ordinary bird shed these.
Something preyed on this beast...<cf>This is no man's work.
The poor beast... Goblin handiwork,<cf>like as not.
This place must have seen a ferocious<cf>battle.
A fetching view for certain, but I<cf>fear we're quite vulnerable here.
Such open locales make fleeing from<cf>enemies a tricky proposition.
An ancient fort, to be sure. Who<cf>can say just when it was built?
This fort was built by a duke of old.<cf>I reckon it's worth investigating.
It appears to be a bandit hideout.
'Twould be wise to not arouse the<cf>ire of the local bandits...
That tower would offer a commanding<cf>view. Perhaps we can scale it?
Mind your steps, Master. This fort<cf>holds many twists and turns.
Is that birdsong? Perhaps we'll<cf>find a nest nearby.
A wealth of materials lies close, I<cf>believe. Let's have a look.
Look, Arisen -- a rope.<cf>Seems suspicious...
I don't care to meet whatever left<cf>these giant footprints behind...
Caution, Master. Massive beasts<cf>prowl this area.
That's not a pleasant odor...<cf>Monsters must be near.
That's goblin I smell, Master.<cf>Keep close watch around us.
Forest rocks are oft coated thick<cf>in moss. Keep an eye out for them.
We may be able to glean material<cf>from the boulders of this wood.
There's a hint of salt in the air...
Feel that salty breeze. We must be<cf>nearing the sea.
This area is likely rich in rabbit<cf>and other wild game.
We must reclaim the base if we hope<cf>to halt the goblins' advance.
The southern fort is a den of<cf>thieves, now. We must be cautious.
A bandit of the Stone yet remains in<cf>Cassardis, yes?
Be careful, Master. The bandits here<cf>fight as demons.
Monsters fearsome strong prowl these<cf>byways, Master. Be careful.
Watch the ground for traps, goblins<cf>have strung the area with them.
Beware, Master. Some goblins are far<cf>more powerful than others.
Human foes may fight as fiercely as<cf>any monster, if pressed.
Be careful, Master. The forest wolves<cf>attack in packs.
The goblins of this forest have a<cf>taste for human flesh.
I can only hope this forest will<cf>someday be rid of monsters.
I sense monsters all around... If we<cf>enter the forest, go ready for battle.
Goblins dwell nearby, if I recall.
Monsters never want for hiding spots<cf>in the forest.
We must not hasten to confront the<cf>dragon, Master.
A representative of my kind looks<cf>after the rift entrance in Gran Soren.
The monsters that harry us so...<cf>It was not always in their nature.
The mild weather year-round makes<cf>Gransys well suited for human life.
Yet rising monster populations have<cf>made roads hazardous in recent years.
As a consequence, the Gransys' sea<cf>routes have been ill developed.
Not even the saltiest fishermen<cf>venture far from shore, I hear.
The Brine have lurked along the<cf>shores since ancient times...
Navigating the region is possible<cf>only via special roads.
'Tis fear of monsters and the wyrm<cf>that gives rise to fortresses...
'Tis no surprise, of course, that<cf>many a bandit lurks here as well.
This must be it, the "man with a<cf>scarred chest."
The dragon has been dispatched...<cf>So why has the sky turned dark?
Is...is this the world the Arisen<cf>was meant to bring about?
Tis little use standing around here.<cf>Let's have a look at her quarters.
Perhaps Quina left some clue at her<cf>home.
We'll need Quina's help for this.<cf>Let's ask at the village.
Let's speak with he who leads this band.
I feel half a thief myself, sauntering<cf>through this place.
That should buy us safe passage.
Fight or flee, the choice is yours.
This path should see us there.
To the encampment.
The peddler is outmatched. Shall we<cf>lend a hand?
This road will have us to the<cf>encampment ere much longer.
We've arrived, Master.
What meaning do you suppose those<cf>stones hold?
'Tis a portcrystal. With a ferrystone,<cf>you could reach it from anywhere.
'Tis a Portcrystal, Master.
We've near arrived!
For a man to meet their leader...<cf>Mayhap if he wore a woman's kit.
These bandits' leader will not even<cf>speak with a man.
A battle well fought!
Let us return to the encampment.
We've no choice... To arms!
'Twas a close scrape, that...
I'll support you!
Come! To battle!
We know not what's inside...best be<cf>prepared for anything.
The Westron Labrys's base...<cf>Their leader is an infamous misandrist.
Just down this road, Arisen.
Best we return at night.
Upward, Master.
I see it! Over there!
Arisen! Maker be good, you've returned!
Just after you'd left, a slain cockatrice brought as a trophy for His Grace came alive.
The beast was well and truly dead, I'll aver it. Brought back by some dark art, no doubt.
The local folk have fled to safety, but the beast's rampage is like to destroy the other freight.
That tribute is the duke's own property, ser. The creature must be slain, and quickly!
We held our ground, somehow. Not a single trophy was lost, ser.
'Tis a testament to the efforts of the Arisen. You have our thanks, ser!
Order has been restored, though not without casualty.
A few of the trophies were lost. An unavoidable fate, given the circumstances.
I am relieved to see you well, Aldous. Arisen.
The beast was driven off, but I fear the tribute lies in ruins. 'Tis a mercy no lives were lost.
Hnngh... I was...a fool...
Don't lash out wildly! Everyone, focus your attacks!
All grows...dark...
I'm not ready... I'm not...
Order! I will have order!
This inquest has its conclusion.
Fournival Frescobaldi!
In the name of His Grace, Duke Edmun<cf>Dragonsbane, the court hereby proclaims its<cf>verdict...
Guilty!
Whereas you have deceived your fellow man to sate your avarice, the court sentences you to life imprisonment!
The inquest is hereby ended!
Not guilty!
You are cleared of all charges and released from bondage forthwith!
The inquest is hereby ended!
Milady!
Mirabelle!
These good men are from Meloire.<cf>They'll see us safely home.
Come, milady...
Let us be off for home!
I am well eager to be quit of this place!
Let's be done with dragons and that awful duke...
That one deserves to be eaten up!
I'll shed no tears when that beast<cf>leaves this land in ash.
I fear this is farewell, dear champion.
I'll never forget you. I...!
All right, milady!
Let's be off! Quickly, now!
I swear it, my love!
I'll never forget!
What aim does this place serve? I feel its pull, and know it deeply tied to my kind...
And yet I know naught of its purpose...
What are you doing, man!? Make haste!
Ungh.
Waauh!
Uwaaaugh!
Yah!
Rrragh!
Hoy!
G'bye!
Aye.
Enh...
Oh, thanks!
Thanks, that's great!
Huh? D'you call me?
Oh, lemme alone, would you?
I'll get that dragon, just wait and see.
They said I was too young to be a soldier. Not faaair!
I want to keep my family and all safe, too.
If I try real hard, can I become Arisen too?
I wanna grow stronger. I have to!
What's... Why's this happening?
Thanks, that's great!
I fear this task is no simple call to action, ser. It will no doubt take time and a more...subtle approach than your other work.
Perhaps you've heard of the society they call "Salvation."
In truth, most of what we know is the product of such hearsay...
They are a band of heretics who worship the dragon, and welcome the perdition it brings.
In the chaos come with the wyrm's arrival, their influence has grown -- ill news indeed.
Pray, keep watch for signs of Salvation as you go about your business. If you find aught, tell me.
Accept
Not now
Good. I'll rest easier for it, ser.
Hmm, I understand your hesitance. 'Tis an uncommon request to make of the Arisen.
But I fear we cannot spare the men to look into it ourselves. I would welcome your help, ser.
I fear even now, Salvation's grip tightens around the hearts of the people...
I would ask you report anything you learn of their activities, Arisen.
Accept
Not now
We know little of Salvation, and what we do know is but fragments.
Who leads them, what action they take, their ultimate goal... All of this remains unknown.
That vexes the task of gathering new information, I know.
Perhaps the most sensible tack is simply to inquire among the citizens of Gran Soren?
Salvation meets within catacombs, you say?
I know of only one such place here, a crypt that opens upon the northwest.
No sane man would think to approach it, nor would any honest man have cause to...
Just what are they plotting?
Then the gatherings of Salvation did have sinister purpose...
Hmm, 'tis a grave shame the Elysion slipped our snare.
We shall redouble our vigilance here to keep the city safe...
I fear you are as like a target as Gran Soren, though. Pray, be wary, Arisen.
For now, I leave you with my thanks.
Th-that...was a bad...idea...
P-please... Herbs... I need...herbs...
Many thanks, cos. Might I ask what brings you so far afield?
You came in pursuit of me? ...Forgive me, cos. I guess it's nothing new.
What can I say? I seize upon some idea -- or perhaps I should say the idea seizes me -- and afore I know it...
Well, I suppose all is well enough now. I'll go back to the village with all speed. 
I shall endeavor to limit any future explorations to nearby the encampment.
Not...again...
P-please... Herbs... T-two of them...
P-please... I need herbs... T-two herbs...
I am eternally in your debt, cos...
After my last trial, I thought to bring herbs of my own, but they were used all afore I took notice...
Seems caution is first to go when inspiration strikes.
Still, I'll count this journey a success -- made more so by your fine company.
Perhaps to the Witchwood, next...
Y-yet again...
P-please, cos... I need herbs... Th-three...
Please...more herbs...
A thousand apologies, cos. Somehow you always end up bearing my burden...
I considered myself well-equipped this time! Truly! But my stores were heavy, and the monster quick of foot, and...
And I lacked the everyday sense to avoid such a mess in the first place.
In the future, I shall confine my explorations to the village proper.
These wanderings of mine lead only to trouble.
I'll straightaway to home, and no delay. You have my word on this.
Ah... How I wish I had your strength.
It would greatly aid my travels, no doubt. As is, I could scarce best an ornery hare.
Yet, my wanderlust heeds no caution. I am called to explore by all that I am.
It is my very nature...but I would better control it, lest it also become my very doom.
If not for you, mostlike I'd have perished in the wild.
You have taught me a dear lesson. I shall spend all night preparing for my next expedition!
Cos? You stare through me...almost as if you do not fully believe me.
Mmm... Those herbs of yours are potent indeed!
I've never had their equal. I wager I could take heel and sprint to the Witchwood and back!
Hmmm... Now that I think on it...
Help... Someone, help me...
Hnngh... So dark...
Is... Is this...the afterlife...?
M-my back... And neck... And head... S-stomach, too...
Pray, a moment. I would not ask this of anyone but you, cousin...
I've news for Merin...dark news. I fear I cannot bring myself to face him. Will you go in my stead?
Accept
Not now
I would not ask this of anyone but you, cousin. I've news for Merin...dark news.
His brother is dead. It happened down the shore a ways.
We were fleeing the wyrm, and he... Cortese leapt before the beast's talons to shield us.
I saw it... Saw him sent hurtling through the air. Saw him fall back to the ground...
I did nothing. Just watched the poor man die...
I cannot face Merin for the shame of it. He deserves to know what happened, but I...
Please... Please, go and tell him.
His brother is dead; it happened down the shore a ways.
We were fleeing the wyrm, and he... Cortese leapt before the beast's talons to shield us.
I saw it... Saw him hurtling through the air. Saw him fall back to the ground...
I did nothing. Just watched the poor man die...
I cannot face Merin for the shame of it. He deserves to know what happened, but I...
Please... Please, go and tell him.
Aye... You've the right of it. I ought tell him myself. He deserves as much...
Merin was e'er the proud brother... He loved Cortese dearly.
He has right to know of his brother's death, but... I've not the courage... I've not...
Please, cousin. For his sake, if not mine.
I thank you, cousin. Pray, forgive the trouble my cowardice has placed upon you...
Cortese did not trade his life for mine so I could wallow in idle self-pity.
I'll live the best I am able. For his sake.
I spoke with Merin. We'll build Cortese's grave together, the two of us.
It grieves me to have lost a friend, but he would not have wanted his legacy to be one of sorrow.
I'll live the best I am able. For his sake.
I sense a presence of pure darkness...
There, floating!<cf>'Tis an evil almost palpable.
A great evil pulses from the fiend.
It courses with a magick<cf>uncommon strong...
A lich, Arisen!
Shoot the gas from a distance!
The gas can be dispersed!
We must destroy the miasma!
A wight!
A host of wights!
There, Master! Wights!
A wight comes!
A lich!
A host of liches!
There, Master! Liches!
A lich! There!
The fiend commands powerful magick!
'Tis a ghoul sorcerer, and powerful!
We've poor luck... Wights, Arisen!
An undead grand wizard! Be careful!
'Tis a mighty spellcaster!
The undead are weak to holy light!
I'll cleanse it with sacred light!
Let this strike cleanse it to ash!
This ought be the fiend's undoing!
It summons more monsters!
'Tis conjuring monsters!<cf>We must stop it!
It alights! Now, attack!
'Tis aground! All hands, attack!
Stop its summoning with a<cf>blunt strike!
This should silence it!
Holy light will stop its conjuring!
Begone before this sacred light!
'Tis fallen! Quickly, upon it!
That spell is trouble... Quickly, away!
Stay clear of the fetor it conjures!
Would we could strike it from range...
That cackle... No, it cannot be...
Let's be rid of those on land first.
Perhaps if we struck now!
What magick is this? I fear the answer...
I sense a terrible magick close by!
Dark bishop!
'Tis a dark bishop--a necromancer of<cf>dragons!
Strike at it with the power of darkness!
Holy light is powerless against it!
Our magick is little threat to such a<cf>master!
'Tis that fiend controlling the cursed<cf>dragon!
Hurry! It readies a massive spell!
The dragon will not die till we slay its<cf>master!
Hold off the dragon as I focus on the mage!
The necromancer has vanished!
The mage has possessed the corpse dragon!
Evade the dragon as you focus on the mage!
Drive out the necromancer by striking the<cf>beast!
Now! While it's been driven from the<cf>dragon's body!
There, a light... Someone's lamp, perhaps?
A queer shadow approaches!
A reaper of souls?!
Death is come!
The reaper comes, Arisen!
Arisen, you must aid the fallen!
'Twas a narrow victory...
Seems it's gone...
That scythe's edge harvests men's souls!
You cannot allow its blade to find you!
Its lantern's magick lulls men to sleep!
When the lantern shines, fall back at once!
'Tis the end if its scythe finds you asleep!
Stay sharp! It moves in the blink of an eye!
When--But how?!
Death will not be slain in one go, ser.
Hold fast, and drive this evil back!
The fiend's scythe brings certain death!
Uh!
Guh!
Wauuugh...
Hmph!
Hraah!
Hoy.
Fare well.
Aye.
No...
My thanks.
Quite kind of you, really!
No doubt you're sick of hearing it, but this dragon is death for business.
I suppose we'll be lucky if that's all the harm it does...
I took to the road to test my fortunes as a traveling merchant.
So I come all this way, and arrive in time with the dragon. Some fortune, eh?
I came in from the north, down 'round the jetty.
As I passed the tower there, I came upon a flying beast of massive scale...
I'll not cross that stretch again, save the dragon itself is chasing me.
I had thought to cross the mountains at the Greatwall to the west, then hook north to home...
Now I hear tell that's where the damned dragon's taken to roost!
I really have come at the worst of possible times...
The sky has gone dark, and the land crawls with every manner of beast gone mad...
The end is upon us all... We're through, the lot of us.
Quite kind of you, really!
Move along, there!
Aye, what? The manse stands empty now.
As it ought, if you ask me.
Here on the duke's business?
We'll have no pawns inside. You go alone.
Nh.
Nngh!
Gaugh...nngh...
Hah!
Shoh!
Hard at work for His Grace?
If you will excuse me.
That is so.
No.
Mm, I thank you.
You have my utmost gratitude.
What progress, Arisen?
'Tis a high honor indeed to be charged with executing the Royal Orders, passed down directly from His Grace.
Pray, see that you take to them with proper reverence.
Tis truly lamentable to find that, even in such dire times, knaves and blackguards remain eager to flout the law for personal gain.
A restlessness pulls at the edges of all of our minds, it seems.
We are tempted to madness by the knowledge that the capital may fall at any moment. Nay, the whole of Gransys...
Never was it truer that ignorance is the fellest foe, and apathy the greatest treason.
If I may be permitted to speak frankly, 'tis my own opinion the duke's court has fallen into decline.
They no longer band together to make common purpose for the good of the land. Even His Grace is not the same imposing presence of old...
But I forget myself. Pray, pay me no mind.
Tell me, Arisen, what think you of Ser Mercedes, appointed captain of the Enlistment Corps?
Talk of her as naught but an ornament can oft be heard on the less prudent lips of the court.
Still, I daresay her concern for the welfare of this land is earnest.
More's the pity, perhaps, that earnestness alone does not an apt leader make. If she cannot command respect, she is lost.
Would that she at least had someone to aid her in her efforts...
I hear it told His Grace was once an avid patron of magickal scholarship.
The restoration of the flesh, in particular, held his interest. He set many a scholar to crafting an art to revive the mortally wounded.
'Tis a cruel shock. The Stone was entrusted to Ser Daerio, famed for his iron fealty.
To hear of what has happened... 'Tis simply a shock.
At this rate, no man is above betrayal. Must we live in constant fear of...
No. I shall not speak of it.
To give voice to such suspicions makes me ill better than that pack of zealots. We must trust in the good of all men.
What progress, Arisen?
'Tis a high honor indeed to be charged with executing the Royal Orders, passed down directly from His Grace.
Pray, see that you take to them with proper reverence.
Salvation grows bolder by the day. Their designs now stand apparent.
I hear it told they preach a twisted creed wherein destruction is the true deliverance. Rot, all of it, but it sways the people's hearts still.
They are the basest sort, eager only to win over others to validate their mad revels.
And yet they cannot be ignored, lest the unease they sow turn against the duke and give rise to another revolt.
The leader of their mad cult must be put to chains, though the villain has eluded all capture thus far.
They make clear their true nature, scurrying about as rats.
Though I now serve His Grace as a chamberlain, I yet know precious little of the man...
I suppose the most stalwart of heroes bears his share of scars. Even dukes are men, aye? Troubles and all.
I've no words to describe what took place at the Greatwall...
'Twas a lesson in just how pitiable man is in the shadow of the wyrm.
It weathered the whole of the duke's army with all the care an ox pays an ant.
I fear we can do little else but entrust our hopes to you, Arisen.
I'm sorry, I truly wish there was aught we might do to help.
Ah, Arisen. I ask that you present yourself before the duke with all haste.
His Grace has a matter of grave importance to discuss...
What meaning can this hold...?
I cannot believe it... That you would... That you could be capable of such...
No... It beggars all comprehension.
So all this we owe to you, Arisen.
'Tis a shame. A grave shame indeed...
You have my utmost gratitude.
Somewhere abundant with plant life would likely grow the herbs we seek.
Selene of the Witchwood deals in many an herbal tonic. Perhaps she knows aught?
Let's see these back to Arsmith.
Notices requesting work? Perhaps we should take a look.
What are we to seek this time, Master? Whate'er it is, we are yours to command.
Good work, Arisen. May the next task go as smoothly.
The Everfall holds death for the<cf>careless.
Let us make for the bottom.
I feel aught calling from the depths...
Run! Go, quickly!
We must run! Now!
There is no way we can face this<cf>monster!
...An evil eye!
Run! If it grabs you, you're done for!
Do not attempt to fight!<cf>We must flee!
'Tis strange... This place feels<cf>somehow...familiar...
So this is the Everfall...
What a queer feeling...<cf>Like a tugging at my soul...
This is not the last we shall see of<cf>this place, I am certain...
That queer light... Shall we take a<cf>closer look?
What could that odd light be?
What could be causing this light?
Strange, this light...
Let's speak with Barnaby.
We'd best return to the Pawn Guild<cf>and inform Barnaby.
Come, Master!
A queer feeling weighs upon my chest,<cf>Master... A foreboding...
I sense monsters about...
All we seek awaits below...
We stand at the threshold to truth,<cf>and all beyond it...
'Tis fearsome deep... Fit to pierce the<cf>very heart of the world.
'Tis like the very earth is poised to<cf>swallow us...
'Tis a queer feeling...
I feel I'm half falling, half ascending...
We fall, and fall beyond...
No ground rises up to meet us.
This must lead back to the surface.
This will return us to the surface.
We can take this path back to the<cf>world above.
'Tis a gate... A nexus linking all the<cf>worlds.
The countless worlds are linked.<cf>Bound to this place, all...
This shaft is the axis along which all<cf>turns... 'Tis the source.
The world we knew is but a single leaf<cf>upon a vast tree...
We stand at the trunk of all the<cf>branching worlds. The very root...
My kind are nomads... We belong to no<cf>world, and to all.
An endless labyrinth...<cf>We'll ne'er leave this place.
Ngh!
Nrhh!
Aaargh...
Hnh!
Hrgh!
Ho, friend!
Don't be scarce, now!
A'yes.
No, no.
Aw, thanks!
Haw haw! Nice, nice!
I take cheer our village survived the attack at all.
Many claim the dragon foretells the end of days.
Such talk is folly. We have survived cruel sickness and fierce storms, and we shall weather the dragon.
Those who fled the village...I wonder where they might be?
I pray the Maker guide them back to us safely.
Truth be told, dragons aren't such a terribly rare beast.
When our chief was but a minnow, the Duke slew a wyrm what appeared near these very shores.
They visit the mainland from time to time as well, if what I hear can be trusted.
A dragon is as a storm, don't you think? It blows in, wreaks its havoc, and then vanishes, quick as it came.
Hear you've taken up work over at the encampment, eh?
Aye, the recruiters' drums ring loudest at the sight of a dragon.
The Enlistment Corps speaks bold enough, but it's all an act.
I gainsay they'll ever build a force large enough to outclass a dragon.
Ha! First the dragon, now a hydra. No beast is safe from you, cousin!
The old women say our chief set off on a great journey of his own, once.
Old Adaro never gained sway over pawns, though.
That's one you have on him.
And how does the life of an Arisen suit you?
I do hope you take a mind to enjoy it. Pray make time to accept a few pints from grateful citizens, at the least!
Hold, Arisen. I would have you hear me.
The village has hopes for you, yes, but do not lose yourself in your task with the dragon.
The wyrm is ancient already -- he can wait a bit longer.
But you... Swear to me you'll see the world, while you still have your youth.
Surely you've heard Duke Edmun was himself named Arisen once?
At times of war or great crisis, Arisen are free to travel the land as they will...
Even balanced with your burden, it is a powerful right. You would be good not to squander it.
Go forth, cousin! Slay foul creatures! Champion the small folk! Let word of your deeds carry across lips throughout the land.
And with fortune's favor, perhaps one day you might claim the title of duke yourself...
Pursue your ambition, but only with great care. She is a fickle mistress, after all.
Dreams of glory have spilled out of many a dead man's head.
I think oft on the dragon... There almost seems some purpose in his mayhem.
The wyrm could raze our entire village with but a thought...
But instead he grants us quarter and returns to his secret slumber.
Perhaps the dragon awaits something...or someone... Perhaps he awaits you, Arisen...
The more I think on it, the more I consider that dragon is waiting for your visit, Arisen...
I think it has...chosen you, somehow...
Well, one can only spend so long pondering the wyrm's grand design. 
Do what you feel is just, and the Maker will guide you true.
Can't help but consider if the dragon hoped for death by your hand from the start, eh?
Trust your instincts, cousin. They won't lead you astray.
You've done what you felt right each day from the first.
So what cause have you to stop? Been nothing but a smooth sail till now, hasn't it?
Ho, friend!
Ho! I just got word of your brave stand.
Gave that vile beast what for, didn't you? No doubt he's off licking his wounds as we speak, eh?
Apologies -- I would not make light of your encounter with the dragon.
Many good men were killed or wounded when the beast struck.
...We cannot gnash our teeth forever, can we?
Haw haw! Nice, nice!
Begging your pardon, ser, but I cannot permit anyone through.
More monsters spill through the pass by the day. It's all that damnable dragon's fault!
You should know I cannot allow passage, save with dire cause.
They say you slew a hydra, and even now return to Gran Soren with its head as a prize... Are the stories true?
If you would bring the creature's head to the capital, I shall permit you passage without delay.
The lands teem with beasts and...other creatures. Best be on your guard.
I've heard whispers... They say you are the Arisen.
As Arisen, you are allowed full passage throughout our lands. 
Even the most simple-minded fool could see why Arisen are granted leave to wander our lands.
Anyone with the power to vanquish the dragon is afforded every right and courtesy -- just as they should be.
Ho there! What news? Any closer to finding the dragon?
So the dragon stirs once again...
You...you defeated the dragon, yes?
Somehow I fear this tale is yet far from over. 
What say you, Arisen? Quite the prize, eh?
'Twas I what found it, though I'll claim no glory in the beast's death.
Seems the Maker's at last taken note of all my good deeds!
Off to the waycastle, are you, ser? Safe travels, then.
We're for the west gate, ourselves. There's a caravan come with tribute for His Grace.
Quite the haul, this time. We'll be half the day unloading it all.
Stand firm!
Waaaugh!

Those scales look solid as steel.
It has the look of a reptile.
Saurian!
A bask of saurians!
The fiends are swift. Be wary!
Avoid the venom they spew!
Their spittle is fell poison!
They're armored in hard scales.
Sever the tail to weaken the beast!
They don the colors of their<cf>surroundings to hide.
Saurians can be nigh-invisible.
They mimic their surroundings to<cf>stay unseen.
The scales atop their head are soft.
Saurians are vulnerable to dark magick!
Saurians are no friends of the cold.
Their cold blood cannot abide ice!
The scales along their back are hardest<cf>of all.
Strike the tail!
The tail is severed!
Taste my wrath, reptile!
Strike as it swims!
'Tis defenseless while it swims!
I'll take the beast's sight!
I'll burn it to cinders!
Its head is mine!
The saurian falls!
The reptile is down!
Attack while it's down!
The tail, master!
Sulfur saurian!
A bask of sulfur saurians!
There, Master! Sulfur saurians!
A sulfur saurian comes!
Geo saurian!
A bask of geo saurians!
There, Master! Geo saurians!
A geo saurian approaches!
Saurian sage!
A bask of saurian sages!
There, Master! Saurian sages!
Look! A saurian sage!
They block all frontal assaults.
Beware the liquid they spew!
They spit a powerful burst!
Such power...
'Tis cloaked! Be vigilant!
'Tis cloaked! Watch close!
I'll drive it back best I'm able!<cf>Stand firm!
Beware its spear!
Let's end this afore they reach land!
I'll sink it where it swims!
Attack it where it swims!
I've a hold on it! Sever the tail!
I've a hold on it! Set it ablaze!
I've a hold on it! Strike it with ice!
I'll have its tail off in a trice!
Now! Cleave the tail from its body!
Now! Its tail is exposed!
The slime it spews is stubborn as pitch!
That slime hobbles its victim's<cf>movement!
Don't be careless, even against the one!
Even alone, 'tis a formidable threat!
We'll not outlast it! Quickly, attack!
I cannot hold it long! Hurry!
I'll hold it best I'm able! Strike the tail!
An unsettling beast... Stay wary!
I'll watch for the chance to strike!
Its scales are tough indeed!
Its tail is most likely its weakness!
Ice is bane to saurians!
Wood and water are oft home to<cf>saurians.
Flame serves well against that reptile.
Its slime clings and hampers victims!
It aims to hide itself, then attack!
A strong flame may take it out!
Strange saurians reside in these parts.
Striped saurians are fast and fierce<cf>both.
Tread lightly. Danger oft comes<cf>unannounced...
The black lizard's weak to ice.
Fire has little effect.
It spit potent acid!
Its scales mock even the sharpest blade!
Large or no, their tails are still a<cf>weak point.
Hulking black saurians prowl<cf>this place...
We cannot afford to be surrounded.
It spat at us!
It's disappeared!
I fear danger lurks just below the<cf>surface...
Did you see movement just now?
Gah! 'Tis a giant lizard!
Perhaps these dislike ice as well.
Mayhap their tails are weak as well.
Waugh! It spews some white sickness!
There may be saurians...
Best we kept away from the water's<cf>edge.
Something smells...fishy.
It spits a black tar!
A black saurian!? 'Tis... 'Tis huge!
Saurians have an advantage at the<cf>water's edge!
I'll serve as bait. Strike the tail!
Their spears have long reach.
The tail! Hurry, while I've ahold!
Those scales and spears are an<cf>unwelcome combination.
Crush the lot of them once they're<cf>frozen.
Dark magick fells saurians with ease!
It recovers Health through magick!
Don't let them touch that shining liquid!<cf>The enemy must not recover!
Sever the tail to drive it into a frenzy!
'Tis said eerie, white saurians<cf>appear in this area.
That saurian wears a cloak of flame.
Is that the source of this stifling<cf>heat?
Pyre saurian!
There, Arisen! Pyre saurian!
A bask of pyre saurians!
Ice is nemesis to their kind!
Douse them to quench those flames!
Snuff out their flames!
Simply touching them yields grievous burns!
Such heat! You mustn't get too close!
More fire will only nourish them!
Focus on those whose flame is quenched!
Sever the tail and the fire abates for a time!
If you've a flask of water, let it fly!
A saurian...? But 'tis enormous!
There! A colossal reptile!
'Tis a saurian, ser!
I see a massive saurian!
'Tis a bask of saurians!
I mislike the feel of this place.
The air is awhirl with grief and rage.
This place is the forge where warriors come to hone and temper their skills.
It's closed for repairs, presently, but ought be open again afore long.
The men of the Enlistment Corps never turn away the eager. We're ready to begin. Are you?
Begin training
Not now
Good, good. Let's move to the training ring, then.
I'll warn you now: Lose focus here and you'll pay in pain. Training or no, combat is war.
Hmph. As you will. Come back when you've steeled yourself to train.
Let me be clear from the outset: I'm a harsh master, whoever the pupil.
You'll complete three forms of training in sequence.
Each serves to hone a different quality. You'll need more than raw muscle here.
If you find a task too difficult to manage, you might reconsider your party.
There are other pawns here. You can choose among them, if you care to.
The first task is carrying freight. Haul the lot of them before my count ends.
You're free to choose your company, but this is a task too great for just one person.
Many hands lighten any load, as they say. Now, get to it!
We'll begin as soon as you're prepared. Just give the word.
I'm ready!
Not yet...
Your task is to haul all of the freight before my count ends. Get to it!
Next is combat training. You'll face my scarecrow army here. Destroy them before my count ends.
A large group will be of help again, but this task requires an eye for party composition.
A pack of folk all doing the same thing is less effective than a varied approach. Choose well.
We'll begin as soon as you're prepared. Just give the word.
I'm ready!
Not yet...
You'll set about destroying scarecrows this time. Get them all before my count ends.
Right, then. Last, you'll be destroying more scarecrows, but don't expect a repeat of the last.
There are two sorts of scarecrow, each with its own weakness.
One falls only to steel and brute force, the other only to magick.
If you're not mindful how you attack them, you'll fail. Strike fast and strike hard.
Vary your party and your tactics until you find success. Use your head!
We'll begin as soon as you're prepared. Just give the word.
I'm ready!
Not yet...
It's back to the scarecrows for your last lesson. Destroy them all before my count ends!
We'll begin as soon as you're prepared. Just give the word.
I'm ready!
Not yet...
We'll begin as soon as you're prepared. Just give the word.
I'm ready!
Not yet...
We'll begin as soon as you're prepared. Just give the word.
I'm ready!
Not yet...
There are two sorts of scarecrow, each with its own weakness.
One falls only to steel and brute force, the other only to magick.
See that you don't mistake them in your haste.
Are you daft!? You've no time for chatter!
It will come in time. For now, reconsider your tactics and your companions.
Eh, a passable performance. Very well, I'll allow you to advance.
Well done. Meet each challenge with that vigor and you'll make for a fine warrior afore long.
Excellent! I've never seen the likes of it... You'll be teaching here yourself, soon.
Eh, it's well enough. A common sort of success.
You've a steady arm, and a good head on your shoulders. You've done well.
That's the fastest I've seen it done... And on a task fit to challenge even a seasoned warrior.
What's this? Leaving your training, are you?
Stop training
Continue
Feh. Then be off. I'll be here when you're ready to train<cf>in earnest.
Good. There is little hope for those who would abandon their training.
Well done! You've completed your training.
See now the difference well-selected partners can make? Yes, no doubt. No doubt.
You'll learn the rest from actual combat. If you have trouble, examine your party.
Good, you've come... Ready to train?
There... Do you hear it? The howl of a baying beast...
The creatures of this place hunger, ser...
So, it's an escape attempt, eh? Expected better from the Arisen, I did!
You'll gain naught by wasting your pity upon the condemned, Arisen.
And I'll gain naught but needless work. Pray, leave it be.
Damn you, wretch! Flee again, and I'll cut you down where you stand.
Your jests have gone too far, ser. Criminals are punished. 'Tis the law.
Bah! Enough mercy! I gave fair warning, and you ignored it in kind.
Prepare to die!
You will cease your games, ser! I've not the time or stomach for more!
I heard tell a castle worker was in league with bandits.
But the Guard caught wind of the scheme, and he confessed to all not long after.
It seems traitors lurk behind every shrub and henge of late.
Invalid Message
By decree of the duke, you are to be allowed free passage into the castle.
This right extends only to your person, and you are advised to comport yourself fittingly.
A grievous breach in conduct will see you removed from the castle, or worse...
You will take your orders from the duke's chamberlain, Aldous.
Speak to him for further instruction. May the Maker see you on to further glories, ser.
The blustering fools just barged in -- they hold me prisoner like some common criminal!
'Tis madness, and base insult!
You there -- you're an able sort.
There's time yet afore my trial is decided. Pray, arrange for my acquittal however you may.
If you see me through this storm, I'll sell to you at cost for the rest of my days.
'Tis a generous offer, eh?
Now go, and pray put an end to this farce. I am eager to be quit of this confinement... Please, ser.
Augh, I scraped past by the skin of my teeth there... That, and a good bit of help from you.
Your command... compels me here...
I'll waver... no more...
Your command... please...
This pawn... swore eternal fealty...
To be... by your side once more, Arisen...
Where is it...?
There!
This is not yet finished!
The battle at the Mountside Fort raged on beyond all reason, word is. Didn't win it back for us, though.
A pity, but there's naught to be done against numbers such as that.
Chills me to the bone to think of such a horde marching on the capital!
Have you heard tell of the Stone of the Southwest, friend? There's aught afoot there...
It was taken back from the goblins, sure enough, but they say no men yet remain -- that it stands an abandoned ruin...
And now there's tales of an eerie voice and a giant monster, no less. It's a right mess, it is!
Small mercy to know the capital's not the only place beset by such evils...
There's talk of monsters emerging from the shallows all along the shore.
Nasty things, too. The Brine, they call them... They say they're many and yet one, whatever that means.
Seems this "Brine" can't be bested, what's more. Naught to do but avoid the water's edge.
Times are hard indeed...
I've a bad feeling about this...
Selene may be in danger...<cf>We'd best hasten to the Witchwood.
I worry for Selene...
We must find Selene.
Let us hurry to Selene's cottage.
Make haste, Arisen!
Quickly! We must help her!
Let us make for the Witchwood.
How could anyone suspect little Selene?
A hidden path...?
I had no idea such a path existed.
Come, master. We must find Selene.
Where could she have gone...?<cf>We must have missed something.
Could she have gone back here...?
She ran this way, Arisen.
'Tis Selene. And...?
Is this the right way?
We'll follow this road to the waycastle.
The Witchwood is this way, Master.
The Witchwood stands down this road,<cf>Arisen.
Aye, straight ahead, Arisen.
What matter could demand such<cf>secrecy?
The castle courtyard, after nightfall...
Talk of this ilk oft ends in<cf>difficult choices...
You've not forgotten, have you? The<cf>castle courtyard, by night...
We'd best take care no one sees us<cf>enter the courtyard tonight.
The hills surrounding the Greatwall<cf>are overrun with monsters...
The beasts of the foothills around<cf>the Greatwall stole Fedel's pack.
Let us make for the hills near the<cf>Greatwall.
Perhaps we'll find Fedel's letter<cf>within these ruins.
Looks like these are the ruins Fedel<cf>spoke of.
These must be the ruins Fedel saw the<cf>thieving monsters enter...
Do not forget Fedel's talk of the<cf>stolen letter, Arisen.
I see little evidence of the dark<cf>rumblings Fedel spoke of...
I'd wager 'twas gargoyles that<cf>purloined Fedel's letter...
Fedel's pack was stolen by the likes<cf>of those gargoyles, I'd warrant.
Here! 'Tis the letter! Let us hasten<cf>it back to Fedel's hands.
Who truly stands to gain by this letter?
Let's return to the castle.
Night is fallen... Will you meet with<cf>Fedel, Arisen?
We carry precious freight, Arisen.<cf>Best we were especially cautious.
Let's not get lost, Master. Come, this way.
Here, Arisen.
I know the way, Master. Follow me.
Seems we can pass through here.
We can climb down here.
There's a way up here.
This way, Arisen. This way.
After them!
There's aught over here!
This place hides something...<cf>Shall we take a look?
Here's another path, Master.
Down below, Arisen.
We're close, mark my words...
There's another path here.
Come, Master!
We can get down this way.
There's a way down here.
Not that way.
Let us check the map.
We're to wait here once night has<cf>fallen, then?
Aaaaaaugh!
You have naught left to prove, my sweet.
For I have known your love, and know it still.
I have e'er wished nothing more than to share in your world,<cf>be it within the endless chain or beyond.
Let us find our place, together.
To serve her master, and be as she commands. To be<cf>shaped in her image. That is the part of a pawn.
But my master's image is no longer her own. Defeated by<cf>the world-steward, she fell into perdition.
Having witnessed her fail to achieve her<cf>purpose, my breast was filled with regret.
Yet amid that darkness, a spark of light, too,<cf>took root.
Within my soul, a crude and inchoate mirror<cf>to the Arisen's own, new strength emerged.
I had awoken to love.
I came to notice the changes within me as his tireless<cf>ministrations saw my shattered memory slowly mend.
I came to love him, as my master had before me.
Then, some years later, fate came on dragon's wings to<cf>mark him an Arisen, as his master was before him.
Though his heart was lost, he seemed more alive than ever.<cf>He burned with new purpose: to slay the wyrm and avenge Grette.
I became his pawn of my own will.
I, too, saw in this a new calling. To love him, serve him, and<cf>lend him strength. Ultimately, to become as him.
It was a fate I welcomed gladly.
Defeat me, or speak your wish and offer up a sacrifice.<cf>A second time, I heard the dragon's bargain spoke.
Yet I felt a strange reluctance in its tone.<cf>As if the ultimatum were given unwilling.
And in that moment, I knew it.
The wyrm we now faced was my former<cf>master transformed.
The revelation tore him apart. Whichever his<cf>choice, the wages were cruel tragedy.
A new and dark desire poured forth from his sundered soul. His<cf>wish for power to destroy all existence marked me for death.
And yet I never blamed him.
For as my life was snuffed out, I held firm to my belief.
The day would come, I knew, when he, our<cf>master, and I myself would find redemption.
You... You can see me.
Then you are one known to the dragon,<cf>bound within the eternal ring.
I have dire need of the Arisen's strength.<cf>Please, ser, will you lend me your aid?
Yes
No
The boon I ask can be granted only by one<cf>with ties to the wyrm. I beseech you, ser.
I have dire need of the Arisen's strength.<cf>Please, ser, will you lend me your aid?
Yes
No
You have my eternal thanks...
You speak now to a shadow of sorts. My<cf>flesh resides elsewhere.
I would take you there now, if it please you.
This shadow can but point the way, ser.
Shall I see you to the island?
Yes
No
Then I shall await you here.
We stand now on Bitterblack Isle, far asea<cf>from the cove we departed.
I would ask you to explore its depths.
From its deepest heart, I sense the will of<cf>one such as yourself, touched by the wyrm.
I beg you, ser... Find that lost soul, and<cf>lead it to redemption.
Were it possible, I would not send you off<cf>with so meager an explanation.
But I fear I myself do not know it better.<cf>My past, my aims in coming here, all of it<cf>is lost as in a fog.
All I know is that I, like you, was called<cf>here, and am bound to stay. I sensed you in<cf>the distance, and called to you for help.
I knew somehow, as by instinct, that you could<cf>grant the wish of the one who dwells below.
Just as I know my role here is to aid you in that<cf>pursuit.
I am versed in the purifaction of cursed<cf>artifacts.
Should you, in your travels, find such ensorceled<cf>objects, pray bring them to me.
The procedure requires but a few rift<cf>crystals, and it is a service I would<cf>gladly tender.
My hope is that I may rediscover myself,<cf>and recall my true purpose here.
I shall aid your journey in any way I can, and<cf>pray that our goals both lie together.
It is with heavy heart I say the man you<cf>have brought back from below is not the one<cf>I seek.
He is but another traveler, brought here from<cf>another world.
'Tis slow work, but I've been endeav'ring<cf>to remember more about myself.
...It seems I, too, was one linked to the<cf>wyrm by fate.
In my questing, I came to this place, yet...<cf>the will of some other entity took hold of<cf>me, and bound me here.
The words I spoke begging your aid were not mine,<cf>but theirs...
Beyond that is still a haze.
What am I meant to do here, truly?<cf>...Forgive me. 'Tis not a query you could<cf>answer when I myself know not.
You've met him...
He was my master, though it was a hundred<cf>lifetimes past.
When he came to face the dragon, he was<cf>given a choice too hard, too cruel to make.
He could live with neither answer, and so he<cf>offered only a curse in reply. Those words<cf>saw him become the monster he is now.
In granting him the cursed form he chose,<cf>the wyrm had held to its bargain... and I<cf>was the price.
I was his pawn, and his beloved besides.
Please... You must free him.
Let your iron will be as a hammer to shatter<cf>the bonds of hate that keep him here.
And if freedom is beyond his reach, pray offer him<cf>at least a peaceful end...
Please, ser... I beg you to help him.
Let your will prove the stronger, and crush<cf>the bonds of enmity that hold him.
His soul has been a slave too long. Pray,<cf>bring his suff'ring to a merciful end...
Older memories are bubbling to the surface...<cf>though they show a past which is not my own.
I recall fighting... I was in the service of a great<cf>warrior, and together we overcame many trials.
Her ill-deserved end was a crushing blow to me<cf>as well. My soul was shattered.
...Much as I then came to shatter his.
What recollections I have seem so vivid, and yet<cf>all else beyond them is a haze...
I feel my soul is an amalgam of my own and that<cf>of someone else, as two halves of a single whole...
Strangely, the thought causes me no distress.
It grows clearer, now... My circumstances<cf>here, and what it is I must do.
I am not... The soul that animates this<cf>body is not its natural pair.
But I had to save him, at any cost...
The master of this black isle. He created<cf>these labyrinthine halls, and has the power<cf>to draw Arisen into them.
In my desperation to see him redeemed, I<cf>wrested away control of this body...
I must believe my claiming this body... my<cf>calling you here held some meaning.
I feel as if freshly awakened from some<cf>long dream...
Yet I heard clear each word exchanged 'tween you<cf>and the one who possessed me. I remember them<cf>still.
That woman... She, too, was named Olra.<cf>Perhaps it was that chance bond that led<cf>her spirit to me.
And through me, she called to you. To one<cf>whose strength of will outmatched the master<cf>of this place.
Arisen or no, my own will seems a guttering<cf>candle to your sun.
...I shall remain here awhile, I think. To<cf>contemplate the meaning of our meeting here.
The meaning of the Arisen's charge, of the<cf>quest to reclaim one's heart... The more I<cf>think upon it all, the murkier it grows.
That monstrous thing yet lives?
The Arisen who brought this place into being<cf>is gone, but perhaps some other force yet<cf>remains which fueled his long grudge...
In my earliest memories, I am...standing here, on<cf>this jetty. I hear a voice.
It entreated me to save...someone.
Upon hearing her words, I fell into a terrible<cf>confusion.
It felt as if... As if that voice had been my own.
I fear there is little more I can tell you about<cf>the one I brought you here to aid.
'Tis a mad request, I know.
I scarce know who I am, let alone this other soul...
And yet, at my core, it is their fate, not my own,<cf>that weighs more heavily upon me.
You are Arisen, like as me.
Chosen of the wyrm, and lead by it... Or a sacrificial<cf>lamb at the altar of its cruel dogma. Which telling<cf>is the truer, I know not.
I ask you--is that the fate you've chosen, of your<cf>own will?
...A foolish question.
Whatever outward circumstances may act upon a<cf>person, their fate is, in the end, a thing of their<cf>own making.
That holds as true for the Arisen as any other.
I... I died once. Here, in this place.
It was scarce a fortnight after I was first lured in.
Each day brought new losses. My pawn was slain,<cf>then gradually my store of curatives dwindled.
I was surrounded, body battered and broken by dark<cf>and powerful magicks. As death approached, I lifted<cf>my gaze to see the stars one final time.
Yet it was not death that engulfed me then, but a<cf>strange light, far brighter than any fire of the<cf>empyrean. ...Past that, my memory fails.
You know of them, do you not? The wyrm. The<cf>Seneschal. The roles they play, and the bargain<cf>they offer.
It is not a choice to be made lightly, and either<cf>path holds its own pain...
But what if both paths in equal part meant<cf>betraying that which you held dearest, and<cf>forsaking all you'd believed?
A man can pick the lesser of two evils, but 'tis an<cf>impossible dilemma when those evils are one and<cf>the same.
Yet pick he must, for indecision and escape invite<cf>evils far worse...
I do not believe that seeking one's own death is<cf>ever the proper course.
'Tis only effort and the unbending will to press on<cf>that sees ill circumstance improved. In death, we<cf>can change nothing.
Yet there are rare times, I believe, when the<cf>destruction of the body IS the path to further<cf>progress.
I do not make light of your decision, nor mean to<cf>imply it was one easily or painless made.
But through it, you have come to live anew. To<cf>meet me here, a denizen of another world.
It was because your will shone brighter, proved<cf>stronger than any other that you reached your end,<cf>and for that same cause you stand here now.
Why do you fight, ser?
To ward the ones you love from evil? To claim<cf>authority o'er the land as conqueror?
'Tis a question all warriors, Arisen or nay, must<cf>ever ask themselves.
...Lest somewhere in the sea of blood and the<cf>seductions of strength we come to find fighting<cf>has become the end and not the means.
Even for one with will enough to earn the dragon's<cf>mark, that siren's song is fearsome strong.
We stand now on Bitterblack Isle, far asea<cf>from the cove we departed.
I would ask you to explore its depths.
From its deepest heart, I sense the will of<cf>one such as yourself, touched by the wyrm.
I beg you, ser... Find that lost soul, and<cf>lead it to redemption.
Were it possible, I would not send you off<cf>with so meager an explanation.
But I fear I myself do not know it better.<cf>My past, my aims in coming here, all of it<cf>is lost as in a fog.
All I know is that I, like you, was called<cf>here, and am bound to stay. I sensed you in<cf>the distance, and called to you for help.
I knew somehow, as by instinct, that you could<cf>grant the wish of the one who dwells below.
Just as I know my role here is to aid you in that<cf>pursuit.
'Tis slow work, but I've been endeav'ring<cf>to remember more about myself.
...It seems I, too, was one linked to the<cf>wyrm by fate.
In my questing, I came to this place, yet...<cf>the will of some other entity took hold of<cf>me, and bound me here.
The words I spoke begging your aid were not mine,<cf>but theirs...
Beyond that is still a haze.
Older memories are bubbling to the surface...<cf>though they show a past which is not my own.
I recall fighting... I was in the service of a great<cf>warrior, and together we overcame many trials.
Her ill-deserved end was a crushing blow to me<cf>as well. My soul was shattered.
...Much as I then came to shatter his.
What recollections I have seem so vivid, and yet<cf>all else beyond them is a haze...
It grows clearer, now... My circumstances<cf>here, and what it is I must do.
I am not... The soul that animates this<cf>body is not its natural pair.
But I had to save him, at any cost...
The master of this black isle. He created<cf>these labyrinthine halls, and has the power<cf>to draw Arisen into them.
In my desperation to see him redeemed, I<cf>wrested away control of this body...
I feel as if freshly awakened from some<cf>long dream...
Yet I heard clear each word exchanged 'tween you<cf>and the one who possessed me. I remember them<cf>still.
That woman... She, too, was named Olra.<cf>Perhaps it was that chance bond that led<cf>her spirit to me.
And through me, she called to you. To one<cf>whose strength of will outmatched the master<cf>of this place.
Arisen or no, my own will seems a guttering<cf>candle to your sun.
...I shall remain here awhile, I think. To<cf>contemplate the meaning of our meeting here.
Ngh.
Ough!
Graaugh...
Hmh!
Rrragh!
Oy there.
Stay alive, eh?
Aye.
Naw.
Thanks.
I owe you one, friend.
<R_G>Do as you're told, and a bit of coin will buy your freedom.
The noblest of convictions can't fill a man's belly as well as the basest coin, aye?
Mayhap I'm serving out my own sentence from some dread crime done in a past life.
I've no love of crowds, and less still of unwanted chatter. Pray, move along, ser.
Mnh.
Guhah!
Gwaaugh...
Hah!
Shaaah!
'ello there.
I'll be off, then.
Mm!
Nay, ser!
Kind of you.
My, my, what 'ave we 'ere?
'Allo! Flavian the crier, at your service. If you have need of news brought forth to the capital's cit'zens, I'm your man.
Wait, 'old on! You're one'a the fighters what went with Mercedes, yeah? Came into town with the hydra's head, you did.
I see... So you did the killin', and Mercedes claimed the glory...
I figured as much, in truth. 
It ain't that I'm lyin' to the people. More like...tellin' 'em a better story, is all.
Mercedes is a knight of the court, well-known 'round these parts, and not hard to look at, if I may say. You gettin' it, then? 
People pay heed once I starts cryin' 'bout dragons and the like. 
Ain't nothin' like a little bit of fear to tell a story, eh?
Word'a your deeds grows with each day. You're like to be the best-known face in these parts erelong.
Between you and me, I expect fair little from Duke Edmun and the few swords he has what remain.
Our fate rests on your steel now, Arisen.
Well, I've done my duty. Any don't know what's comin' now can claim the fault for their own.
So this is the end of it, eh? Or is it the start of something else...
'Ear ye, 'ear ye! The duke's brave Enlistment Corps 'as dispatched the foul hydra what terrorized the southlands!
'Ear the tinglin' tale of the brave Ser Mercedes, she who struck the mortal blow against the vicious creature!
Marvel at the wisdom of 'is Grace, Duke Edmun Dragonsbane, without 'ose counsel the hydra would n'er have been slain!
'Ear ye, 'ear ye! Attend to all! The Arisen has appeared what to take up arms against the fearsome dragon!
Given leave to travel the land by Duke Edmun 'imself, the Arisen takes up sword and shield to defend the honor of all!
Can this Arisen slay the dragon as our Lord Grace did? We wait an' we listen for further word!
'Ear ye, 'ear ye! His Grace, Duke Edmun, has 'imself recognized the great feats of the Arisen!
Does the Arisen's might know no bounds? Do we witness the rise o' this land's next great 'ero?
And what of the pending contest between Arisen and dragon? We wait an' we listen for further word!
'Ere ye, ere ye! Capital in crisis! Tales of open rebellion come from the Greatwall!
Can Gran Soren 'ope to prevail against swarms of evil from the west?
What word from Duke Edmun? What word from the Arisen? We wait an' we listen for further word!
'Ere ye, 'ere ye! Attend and listen! The dragon has awakened and taken flight!
Secure your families! Shutter your 'omes! Make clear the way for women and children! 
The Arisen and castle forces stand ready! All others who may wield arms, secure your steel!
My, my, what 'ave we 'ere?
That terrible creature -- I saw it from my spot at the post... What was it?
It's been dispatched then? Thank the Maker...
Er, hold a moment. Is Quina not with you?
She was said to leave the village in search of aught for your wounds. I thought you accompanied her.
These are dark times for a girl alone in the wilds. Any idea where she might be off to?
The chief worries after Quina as well.
I pray she wouldn't attempt the forest alone. If another beast such as that hydra were to appear...
'Tis locked. You haven't the key to fit it...
'Tis caught on something. Perhaps it could open from the far side.
'Tis barred shut. Might be able to break the bolt.
'Tis shut tight.
'Tis no use at this hour. You'll have to come again later.
Best stop for now.
Seems they're closed.
Someone was here...
Lost them...
Gone...
Perhaps you've upset them.
There's naught to do here.
Best you moved on.
Not here...
The door is closed.
Shows no sign of opening.
There's aught there...
You don't see anything.
That smell...
Someone's near...
What's this...?
Fine view from here.
There's aught written here...
Must be a way to find something...
Smells delicious.
Perfect spot to place something.
You can almost reach...
There appears to be aught ahead.
That fall could kill.
'Tis dangerous to touch.
A strong blow might break it.
Perhaps if you came by night.
Perhaps if you came by day.
Perhaps if you came at dawn.
Perhaps if you came at dusk.
There's aught buried here...
You see no way up.
'Tis slick, this spot.
No use pressing any further.
No need to double back further.
No time for that now.
You cannot carry any more.
There may yet be aught lying about.
Seems there's naught you can take on at present.<cf>Best to try again later.
Perhaps with a bit of help...
Best you kept your weapon sheathed.
Is someone here...?
'Tis a place for tall folk.
'Tis a place for small folk.
Had you a woman in your band...
Had you a man in your band...
Had you a strong companion...
Had you a swift companion...
Had you a magick user...
Had you an apt climber...
Had you a skilled jumper...
This weapon will not help you.
That armor won't protect you.
You're ill equipped for this.
Seems it can't be used now.
You'll get no further use from it.
'Tis useless, now.
Hmm, not with your current equipment...
Not with your current party...
You hear aught from further in.
Enemies... They're close.
Best you got some rest.
You can carry no more!
You're too exhausted!
"Danger! Keep Out!"
"No Trespassing"
A sign.
Had you an Empty Flask, you might fill it here.
You'll get no further without a lantern.
'Tis dangerous to fumble about in the dark. Best find a light.
Best not just leave them.
If aught were left here, it would rot.
Best take care you don't get lost.
Best check the map.
You're due for a rest.
This place is dangerous by night.
This place is dangerous by day.
Breathtaking...
You'll get no further!
Seems you'll need to come back.
Nothing left here.
It looks fit to crumble.
Seems it could be moved...
It will not budge.
It will not open.
Seems you need a key.
Seems you need a Pickaxe here.
You yet lack the experience.
You yet lack the skill.
Not with your current vocation...
You'll not pass through this gate.
You've no time!
Seems you were too late.
You may make it, yet.
You're doing well for time.
Seems you've come at the wrong time.
There may be another path.
'Tis a powerful weapon... Too bad it doesn't work.
Something strong can be sensed from the stone. It <cf>appears the memories of someone have been etched<cf>upon the surface of the Monument of Remembrance.
...I sense someone nearby.
The scent of beasts is thin here. We<cf>should be comparatively safe.
I feel a strange sense of ease here.
Unh.
Gagh!
Gaaah...
Hoh!
Shaah!
'oy there, doing well?
Stay well.
That's so.
No, no.
Oh, you've me thanks.
That's a great kindness, ser. I thank ye.
I had me wife and child take their leave'a this city near a fortnight ago.  
I'm but a farmer. Dragon or no, there's still crops to be tended. 
What good is it to survive if ye starve to death come winter?
I've borne scorching suns and wicked storms, but this dragon's a fury unknown to me.
Aye, this wyrm what everyone's on about reminds me of the weather, like.
Some days ye know what's comin'. And some days ye wake up with snow on your toes and naught but dead crops.
Saw a storm once what had purple lightning. 'Twas the dragon's mischief, I thought.
Some fancy scholar came after with a talk about clouds and air and whattaya 'ave. I made the lad stop afore the Maker struck 'im down.
Truth be told, any talk of the dragon sets me on edge, it does...
Never again... I've 'ad my share of excitement, I 'ave.
Well, there's ain't piss-all for me to do here no mores.
Guess I'll head for the church and 'ave me a talk with the Maker.
You a prayin' sort, Arisen? I figure ya for it, what with all the killin' ya do. 
But then you Arisen seem right busy. Maybe prayer's a thing ya don't have time for, eh?
That's a great kindness, ser. I thank ye.
Uh!
Guh!
Grauuugh...
Hah!
Haah!
How do you fare?
Another time.
Yes.
No.
You needn't have.
I thank you... 'Tis very kind.
...For me, ser?
Better suited to rings than rapiers, am I? Let a woman useless as a knight serve as a wife?
Is this your meaning?
...'Tis a jest, ser. I would be joyed to wear it, as a remembrance of a dear friend.
Aught to say, ser?
Are you here to enlist with the Corps?
Hmm... You've the stature for it, to look at you.
If you've the interest to match, make it known. I cannot warrant you'll be accepted, but all are free to try.
The pawns take you for their master...
Then you are the Arisen... That which bends the legion to their will.
You'll forgive my saying, but you do not look the sort to have such special talents concealed.
The hero Duke Edmun Dragonsbane was Arisen as well, I hear. I suppose the title falls on all sorts, same as any other.
Keep close, Arisen. The duke will have no use for you dead.
You dispatched the hydra with a master's ease, Arisen.
It seems I have misjudged you. Pray, allow me to correct that now.
These last few years have seen no end of villains pretending to the title of Arisen for personal gain.
I fear talk of such frauds led me to suspect you for one of them... I ask you to forgive me.
Duke Edmun bested the wyrm in combat ere he came to rule this land.
'Tis an honor beyond compare to serve under such a legend.
I've no doubt you are among the chosen, same as he, Arisen.
We all expect of you works commensurate with your office, ser. I pray you will exceed our hopes.
At present, over half of the Corps is made of sellswords from other lands.
Each outstrips the next in skill and judgment, and for all the battles they've shared, they band together as a family.
They are formidable, and I am thankful for it... Though it makes the task of leading them more of a challenge.
Unlike your pawns, they've will aplenty. They'll not bend, else to one they respect.
You've made quite the name for yourself since last we spoke.
I fear I must apologize again, ser. On the matter of the slain hydra...
There is talk on the street that it was I felled the beast...
Mistake me not, I told His Grace true that it was your doing alone.
...It seems my name was added as a matter of political expedience.
I've no love of politics. Lies by another name...
And in these dark times, what's more. Who can spare the effort to keep up the dance with the dragon come?
It shames me to say it, but I've not drawn steel in near a fortnight.
This place is a web of designs and politics and I am held fast within it, useless to the world.
All I ask is the chance to fight to ease the suffering of the people of Gransys.
'Twas that and nothing more I came from Hearthstone to do.
I cannot but conjecture what Duke Edmun's aim is in keeping me idle...
As a guest come from a neighboring land, it would ill serve the duke for me to die ere the battle is truly begun.
Nor would he desire me to outshine his men here...
I fear I am caught between the two, and deprived of any task of substance for it.
Aye, I've heard of the party being gathered to slay the griffin.
Ser Georg and the others from the encampment are among them. The men who fought the hydra.
They're touted as elites, but the fact of it is they're mere sellswords.
The harshest tasks are often left to such types, as it was with the whole of the Enlistment Corps.
'Twas but a short while we shared, but they were men under my command just the same.
I would gladly fight alongside them now, were it possible...
Alas, the duke has other use of me.
Arisen... I ask you in my stead. If you choose to join Georg and his men in this hunt...
Pray, see them back alive.
They are competent warriors, to a man, and not apt to die so easily...
But I would rest easier here knowing they march with the slayer of the hydra. ...Please, ser.
All of the men are safe? Truly, they owe you a debt, ser. As do I.
I regret I have naught to give, but I swear upon my name I shall repay you, Arisen.
I mean it true, ser.
I am greatly joyed to know a warrior such as you. One willing to fight for the sake of others.
I see... Even the Arisen could not protect them all...
Forgive me, I do not mean to blame you. The fault is mine for begging the impossible.
The task was difficult, and fraught with danger. Death is ever wed to war.
Still... I dearly wish I might have been there to fight alongside them.
Dead? All of them? ...Merciful Maker.
No, I... I do not blame you, ser. 'Twas a perilous task. Death is ever wed to war...
I must seem a farce of a knight to you.
Shaken so by the deaths of a few men she lead for but a handful of days...
Perhaps that is the truth of it. Perhaps I was never fit to lead...
Pray, let me apologize... I was as like to die of shame as dragon's fire.
To have been the beast's captive so easily, and to have caused you peril for it... I am sorry.
'Twas a duel to the death you fought with the wyrm. Sincere as any I've seen...
And yet there was a sense of...familiarity between you. An air of kinship, almost.
I harbor no delusion that I might have been of any help, had I a blade in hand.
But what's more, there was an aura there, fit to bar any intercessors.
'Twas near enough to make me envious, the bond you shared with the beast as equals.
Pray, do not take offense, but I saw a likeness in you and the dragon.
Where that resemblance lies, exactly, I could not say... But you and it both are things apart from the world. Unique.
I well know that no effort I might spend could e'er make me fit to aid you, Arisen.
I am fit only to believe in you, and wait.
And so I shall. Pray, come back to me alive, ser.

Ah!
Aaanh!
Eeaaagh...
Nh!
Haah!
How do your fortunes fare?
Another time, then.
Oh, aye.
You're wrong there.
...Thank you.
You do know how to treat a lady.
If you want a fight, you've found it!
You'll soon regret that!
Make your peace, fool!
Oh, I'll enjoy this!
Hah! What a sad waste you are.
Aye, what? I'm a busy woman, love.
This cat has claws, fool. D'you want to bleed?
Everywhere you look, it's frowns and empty pockets.
How's one person s'posed to best a dragon, eh? It's idiotic.
Aye, life is hard, but there's no sense in moping.
Best do as you please while you're still alive to do it, eh?
I'll never know the mind of folk happy to slave away at honest jobs.
The Maker's well and done with us, it seems...
...Thank you.
START
Without warning or any clear design, a dragon sets upon Cassardis, the village you call home. The fisherfolk flee in terror from the wyrm, a beast well feared as destruction incarnate. Yet, you decide 'tis better to stand and fight than to flee and falter. You will face this challenge...
You wake to find yourself abed in your room. Was the dragon's assault but a dream? Did the wyrm truly call to you? The disquiet that plagues your heart certainly feels real enough... You'd best check on your belongings and see how the village fares.
The village is calm once again, but the dragon's attack still weighs heavily upon the minds and bodies of your fellow fisherfolk. All this because you could not protect them... You are wracked with shame over the sheer inadequacy of your abilities.
You are encountered by a "pawn", one of a race oft hired for their martial skills. Neither human nor inhuman, these myrmidons make their presence known to those fated for battle. Most like this pawn will lead you down the path you're meant to travel.
You follow the pawn to an encampment of the Enlistment Corps, an army recruited to slay the dragon. No sooner do you enter than strange words echo in your mind -- words that seem to emanate from an enigmatic slate near the camp's command headquarters...
You encounter a "riftstone", some manner of gateway between your world and that of the pawn legion. A voice comes from it, naming you "Arisen", and tasking you with a trial to prove your worth. You know little of these matters, but can only trust this voice is tied to your destiny.
Training underway, you return to Cassardis and come upon a shadowy man with dark words to match. He seems to almost welcome the destruction wrought by the dragon... The encounter leaves you shaken, but you must carry on with your duty.
The voice from the rift pronounces you worthy of being Arisen...one with the power to slay the dragon. You now have pawns at your command, and the hopes of every man and woman in Gransys upon your shoulders...<cf><cf>Doubts still remain over whether you can execute the duty of your new office. At the least, your newfound ability to command pawns has seemed to catch the interest of Master of Arms Berne, and Enlistment Corps Captain Mercedes.
You learn the art of group combat alongside pawns at the training grounds, thus completing another trial. Your new ability to deftly command the myrmidons ought to be a source of satisfaction, yet the yoke of Arisenship grows heavier by the day.
You complete your training as Arisen, earning the power to lead several pawns at once. The captain of the Enlistment Corps requests you join her recruits in their war against the wyrm... As one whose heart bears the dragon's scar, dare you refuse?
As dawn breaks, a piercing wail shatters the calm of the encampment. 'Tis an enormous hydra, putting most recruits to flight. But be it another facet of your training or a true assault, you dare not join in the retreat. Whatever the chances, you must stand and fight.
After a grueling battle, you drive off the hydra, leaving the beast one head lighter. Mercedes, the Corps' leader, advises you that the creature's head should prove your mettle as Arisen to Duke Edmun. Like as not, such feats are required of Arisen, who seem to bear the standard for the entire dragon resistance.
Accompanied by a cadre of Corps recruits, you escort the hydra's head through the mountains and make your triumphant entrance into the city of Gran Soren, domain of Duke Edmun and his vast army. Left to your own devices as Mercedes makes her report to the duke, you wonder if you might learn more of pawns by exploring the city...
You meet the pawn Barnaby, keeper of a great ruin beneath the city known as the Everfall. It seems he has been awaiting your arrival... While his eyes betray no emotion, the absolute faith he has in the Arisen is almost tangible. He asks you investigate a strange aura in the Everfall, and you see no reason to refuse his request.
As you emerge from the Everfall, a member of the castle guard arrives, announcing that your valorous deeds have earned you a place in the Wyrm Hunt. The captain what leads the campaign can be found near the castle gate -- he will have more details.
According to Ser Maximilian, Duke Edmun himself bid you join in the Wyrm Hunt. Your new duties include gathering information on the dragon, investigating the underground cult known as Salvation, and other such deeds across the peninsula that may hold chaos at bay. Hopefully your efforts over the course of these trials will help you glean your true purpose as Arisen.
Your Wyrm Hunt duties leave you weary to the bone, yet through them you find renewed purpose. Each day brings you closer to the truth behind the dragon. Each step tempers the iron of your resolve. The dull ache in your wound drives you forward. If Arisenship is not a crucible for courage, what is?
Your work for the Hunt has caught the eye of Duke Edmun himself, who has granted you a formal audience at court. Should you acquit yourself well, you may inherit yet more crucial missions from His Grace. With luck, meeting this champion of legend will illuminate the path ahead.
Your Wyrm Hunt duties are fulfilled. The duke awaits. You must press on.
You left your audience with the duke bereft of speech. The fierce spirit that once saved the land from the dragon is plain to see in his stately bearing and determined visage. Like as not, such force of will was forged from years spent on the blade's edge between life and death. Seeing this sterling example of all that an Arisen can achieve stirs your heart.
Following the audience, you are granted license to accept Royal Orders: especially urgent missions from Duke Edmun himself. Aldous, the court chamberlain, expresses concern for His Grace, but gives you orders nevertheless. They are plenty to worry about for now.
The Royal Orders pit you against ever-mightier foes, even as you trek farther afield in your investigations. Yet you now command pawns with unrivaled confidence. Truly, you have become worthy of the Arisen title. You could hardly differ more from the callow minnow that left Cassardis so long ago.
As you perform duties as Arisen, you cannot help but witness the chaos the dragon has visited upon the people of Gransys. Some are lost to fear of the wyrm. Others worship it -- the Elysion and Salvation among them. The dragon's overwhelming might has bred a madness that must not stand.
What is an Arisen? A hero? A savior? Can you consider yourself worthy of such regard? In truth, you are but a simple servant, fulfilling your duty -- playing a role in some foretold legend. You guide the pawns, and yet feel a pawn yourself. Your quests bring you ever closer to the dragon, but doubt grows with the ache in your wound.
An urgent missive sends you to the waycastle. What transpires there? A sense of dread weighs on your every step like a great anchor.
You can't believe you fell for such a ruse... Now a giant monster runs amok in the capital! This rampage is most certainly the work of Salvation, a cult that puts chaos upon an altar. You must make haste and annihilate this menace so that peace might return to Gran Soren. 
You dispatch the foul beast, an action befitting the office of Arisen. Damage to the city was not severe, but what could be next? Salvation's heinous schemes could bring this land to the brink. Now the duke asks you to join an expedition... Perhaps leaving your homeland will lead you closer to your goals? You feel adrift as you report to Duke Edmun.
Just as you accept a reward from the duke, word comes of foul deeds at the faraway Greatwall. Salvation has occupied the hold! Duke Edmun commands you to annihilate the cultists at once. You head for the Greatwall more ill at ease than ever...
The dragon appears anew, crushing the Elysion as one might an insect. As the wyrm beckons you once more, you experience an epiphany: find the man most closely tied to the dragon if this struggle is ever to end. The road ahead is clear now, as if the tapestry of your fate has already been woven.
None dare enter the Tainted Mountain. It is a cursed place, the dragon's domain. Prepared for the worst, you forge ahead to wage the final battle. Every step of your journey has led to this.
Awaiting you inside his sanctum, the dragon offers the ultimate choice: raise steel against him, or sacrifice your beloved and become sovereign of the world. After a moment's hesitation, you summon your resolve and make your decision.
Was it the right decision in the end? Such doubts are pointless now. You are no longer Arisen. You have become the world's overlord, able to mold its reality. So why have you lost all hope? Your power is also your prison. Your hereafter is naught but inescapable desolation -- solitude without end.
There is no turning back -- the dragon must fall by your hand. It is time. You know you possess the power. The road shall be revealed before you.
The dragon is no more, but the sudden fall of the world's mightiest power has come with dire consequences. The earth trembles. The sky darkens. The land is in turmoil. You returned to Cassardis, relieved your ordeal was over but unable to bask in your success. Worried over Gran Soren's fate, you make for the capital.
The capital has become a city of horrors. A gaping void pierces its heart to the very bowels of the earth. Half the city vanished into the abyss; survivors are left to gaze vacantly into the great chasm. Surely Duke Edmun could tell you of what transpired here...
All is amiss! The decrepit duke -- once a man you deemed redoubtable -- brands you traitor, the very cause of this catastrophe. As shock roots you to the spot, he summons his soldiers to lock you in irons. The guards pursue you to a man, as if possessed. You have come too far to suffer such an ignoble fate -- you must flee!
Evading your pursuers, you escape into the Everfall. The great hole seems unending, yet that cannot be... A voice on the far side beckons you ever deeper, ever downward, to the end of your journey. You no longer serve any ruler but your own will. You must press on and discover your true fate.
You reach the deepest depths of the Everfall, a realm with neither beginning nor end. Now you face the Seneschal, the omnipotent presence that controls the world itself. This battle will put an end to all doubts. You fight for the closure that shall come with your true fate -- this much is certain as you steel yourself for battle.
In another land, under another sky...<cf>Fading memories claw at your mind as you unfurl dark wings. Once, you were Arisen -- a failed one, vanquished by the Seneschal. Your duty is fulfilled, your reward a dragon's frame. Now a new purpose beckons: seek those who would become Arisen next, and reveal to them the way forward.
A soothing glow lights the shores of Cassardis, healing your mind and body both. Your fellow fisherfolk, Adaro, those you held dear -- all smile at you now, warming your heart with their fellowship. Yes, this is as it should be, for no truth could ever outshine the precious illusion you have crafted for yourself...
Defeated, the Seneschal begs you grant him an end. What could he mean? The Godsbane blade seems to offer an answer.
At last, finally, all is in its place. You have accepted your true fate: to become Seneschal, the new sovereign of the world. Eternal life shall be yours upon the throne -- unending days of service, 'til a new Arisen appears to end your reign.
You feel an odd pride as you plunge the Godsbane into your chest, as if claiming a great victory. Finally, there is an end for your tale -- one penned by your own hand, no less. As your consciousness fades into the black, you feel a peculiar sensation on your lips: you are smiling.<cf><cf>Cleansed by the surf, a body washes ashore on a deserted beach. Nameless, this soul awakens, eyes gleaming with the will to live, and for all things worth living for.
In another land, under another sky, a vast army formed to slay a dragon, the ultimate incarnation of evil. But the army was crushed, and so the people's hopes fell upon a chosen one, and with those who followed this gifted soul. The dragon awaits them in its lair, devising trials they may overcome. Does this tale have an end? We shall see soon enough, should the chosen one be fated to weave one...
The great hole of the Everfall seems unending, yet that cannot be... A voice on the far side beckons you ever deeper, ever downward, to the end of your journey. You no longer serve any ruler but your own will. You must press on and discover your true fate.
The cart! The cart!
Damn Salvation... They grow bolder by the day.
We're fortunate the city suffered so little. 'Tis to your credit, Arisen.
Had you not been here, events would've taken a darker course, to be sure.
His Grace will send word soon, ser. I promise to keep you informed.
Hail, Arisen. Good news!
His Grace has taken notice of your feats and selected you to lead an expedition.
'Tis a difficult task, but of critical importance to the defense of the front.
The duke was adamant that none would do so fine as you, ser.
The journey will take you afar, Arisen.
If you've tasks to complete or personal matters to attend to, pray, do so now.
'Tis like you will not see Gran Soren for some time.
Accept
Not now
The journey will take you afar, Arisen.
If you've tasks to complete or personal matters to attend to, pray, do so now.
'Tis like you will not see Gran Soren for some time.
Accept
Not now
Very well. Make your preparations, ser. I will await you here.
Then come. The duke wished to see you before you set out.
In light of your recent feats, Duke Edmun has seen fit to entrust you with a new charge.
Your efforts during the attack spared at least the castle from harm... The duke has generously seen fit to call that praiseworthy.
I have my own expectations for you, ser. I pray you will live up to them in your endeavors henceforth.
Pray, hasten to His Grace's side. We mustn't keep him waiting.

Something awaits below... I can hear it. A monster, or... No, 'tis something greater.
Aye, fearsome great! I do not wish to know!
Pray, do not turn your gentle face to stone. You are with me<cf>now. Forget the woes of battle.
Take aim at that head!
H-help me!
Nnngh...
I fancied myself a strong man...
Strong enough to protect someone.<cf>Strong enough to love someone.
I longed to prove it. To myself, as much as any other.
Longed to show that I could give aught back, and<cf>not simply take.
And yet, in that moment, I chose to cast it all away.
Though I cursed the world, what was writ true in my soul was an<cf>apology, to you and our master who fostered a soul within you.
You have naught left to prove, my sweet.
For I have known your love, and know it still.
I have e'er wished nothing more than to share in your world,<cf>be it within the endless chain or beyond.
Let us find our place, together.
Word of your feats has reached us here, ser.
You've the wyrm's own strength, to cleft the hydra's pate in one blow!
No doubt you'll prove more than equal to the dragon. I await tell of your next victory!
'Tis locked. You haven't the key to fit it...
'Tis caught on something. Perhaps it could open from the far side.
'Tis barred shut. Might be able to break the bolt.
'Tis shut tight.
'Tis no use at this hour. You'll have to come again later.
Best stop for now.
Seems they're closed.
Someone was here...
Lost them...
Gone...
Perhaps you've upset them.
There's naught to do here.
Best you moved on.
Not here...
The door is closed.
Shows no sign of opening.
There's aught there...
You don't see anything.
That smell...
Someone's near...
What's this...?
Fine view from here.
There's aught written here...
Must be a way to find something...
Smells delicious.
Perfect spot to place something.
You can almost reach...
There appears to be aught ahead.
That fall could kill.
'Tis dangerous to touch.
A strong blow might break it.
Perhaps if you came by night.
Perhaps if you came by day.
Perhaps if you came at dawn.
Perhaps if you came at dusk.
There's aught buried here...
You see no way up.
'Tis slick, this spot.
No use pressing any further.
No need to double back further.
No time for that now.
You cannot carry any more.
There may yet be aught lying about.
Seems there's naught you can take on at present.<cf>Best to try again later.
Perhaps with a bit of help...
Best you kept your weapon sheathed.
Is someone here...?
'Tis a place for tall folk.
'Tis a place for small folk.
Had you a woman in your band...
Had you a man in your band...
Had you a strong companion...
Had you a swift companion...
Had you a magick user...
Had you an apt climber...
Had you a skilled jumper...
This weapon will not help you.
That armor won't protect you.
You're ill equipped for this.
Seems it can't be used now.
You'll get no further use from it.
'Tis useless, now.
Hmm, not with your current equipment...
Not with your current party...
You hear aught from further in.
Enemies... They're close.
Best you got some rest.
You can carry no more!
You're too exhausted!
"Danger! Keep Out!"
"No Trespassing"
A sign.
Had you an Empty Flask, you might fill it here.
You'll get no further without a lantern.
'Tis dangerous to fumble about in the dark. Best find a light.
Best not just leave them.
If aught were left here, it would rot.
Best take care you don't get lost.
Best check the map.
You're due for a rest.
This place is dangerous by night.
This place is dangerous by day.
Breathtaking...
You'll get no further!
Seems you'll need to come back.
Nothing left here.
It looks fit to crumble.
Seems it could be moved...
It will not budge.
It will not open.
Seems you need a key.
Seems you need a Pickaxe here.
You yet lack the experience.
You yet lack the skill.
Not with your current vocation...
You'll not pass through this gate.
You've no time!
Seems you were too late.
You may make it, yet.
You're doing well for time.
Seems you've come at the wrong time.
There may be another path.
'Tis a powerful weapon... Too bad it doesn't work.
Wakestones are miraculous items that can<cf>bring your character, pawn allies, or <cf>others back to life.
Treasure each Wakestone, for the fragments<cf>required to form them are quite rare, and<cf>each stone can only be used once.
Gather enough Wakestone Shards and<cf>they will automatically assemble to<cf>form a complete stone.
Your main pawn will earn rift crystals<cf>while online in other worlds. Encourage<cf>other players to enlist your minion!
A Ferrystone will spirit you back to Gran<cf>Soren in an instant, no matter where you<cf>are located.
It is by far the fastest and safest method<cf>of travel, but each stone disappears after<cf>a single use.
You can equip yourself with a primary and<cf>a secondary weapon.
Primary weapons such as swords and daggers<cf>are combat essentials. Secondary weapons<cf>like bows and shields offer support.
In addition to weapons and armor, you can<cf>also equip accoutrements with certain special<cf>abilities to give you an edge in battle.
Only one piece of jewelry and a single<cf>cloak can be equipped as accoutrements<cf>at any one time.
A heavy load will cause your Stamina to<cf>deplete more quickly. Sell or discard<cf>any and all items you no longer need.
Your lantern consumes oil. If it dims,<cf>use a Flask of Oil to refill it.
Some items can be combined with others to<cf>produce surprising results. Experiment and<cf>see what you come up with. 
Place waypoint markers on your map to<cf>keep track of your progress.
If you've forgotten where you are in the story,<cf>select "Chronicle" from the Pause Menu to<cf>review a history of your journey thus far.
Select "Options" from the Pause Menu to<cf>customize your mini-map and status display.
The higher the fall, the more damage you<cf>will suffer.
Note that you move somewhat slower while<cf>your weapon is drawn.
Exhausting all Stamina will make you unable<cf>to act for a time. Take care to conserve<cf>energy!
You can attack while clinging to foes.
Petrifaction cannot be cured by normal<cf>magick, and is fatal if left untreated.
Use Secret Softener or the like to<cf>cure any petrified allies.
Your rank within a vocation rises as you<cf>defeat foes and complete quests. At higher<cf>ranks, a broader variety of skills are available.
Defeating foes and completing quests earns<cf>you more discipline, boosting your prowess<cf>in a vocation.
Pawns will collect and use items of their<cf>own volition.
You cannot carry or purchase items that<cf>would cause you to exceed your maximum<cf>encumbrance.
Press <TUTO><SIZE 25><ICON TOUCH></SIZE> while climbing down a ladder<cf>to descend quickly. 
If a pawn remains unconscious for too long,<cf>they will be forfeit.
Your support pawn has become forfeit, and<cf>returned to the realm whence they came.
Your main pawn has become forfeit,<cf>disappearing and returning to the rift.
You cannot join covenants with other pawns<cf>while your main pawn is forfeit.
Touch any riftstone to return your lost<cf>main pawn to your side.
If a support pawn is forfeit, any items<cf>they were carrying are sent to item storage.
You can send off departing pawns with a<cf>single item as a gift for their creator.
You can pass items to and from your pawns<cf>on the sub menu.
Keep your distance, filth.
You've no place here.
Aanh?
I've no use for you.
Why are you here?
Don't get cocky, you.
Scared, are you?
Be off with you.
Hoy there. You look eager.
To living easy, aye?
What greater curse than immortality?
What crueler torment than to live in this<cf>place devoid of all but despair?
To the castle, Master.
An audience with the duke...<cf>Quite an honor.
We mustn't keep the duke waiting.
I cannot accompany you to the duke.
Justice Done
Mason burdened you with a difficult choice: slay<cf>the leader, or set him free. It is your duty to<cf>decide.

An important deed went undone.
The gathering's to take place down In the catacombs, I hear.
You'll not find me there. 'Tis far too dangerous a place to brave for a night's diversion.
Maker's breath, 'tis the Arisen. Whatever brings you to such remotes, ser?
I came here to rest a spell along my way, though it seems I've come to the wrong place for a peaceful walk in the woods...
That tablet you carry seems quite the treasure, ser. What meaning does the text upon it hold? ...A mystery to you, too, eh?
Hmm, perhaps such tasks are best left to the learned folk instead of warriors like us. A brother, mayhap, of the Church?
Helping others is their life's work, what's more. If they can tell you aught of that text, they'll do it gladly, I should think.
I would be happy to see it to such a scholar myself, for a small fee, of course. ...No? Pray, forget I made mention of it, then.
If the text upon that tablet interests you, why not consult a priest? They might have aught to say on the matter.
I shall remain here a while longer yet. Pray, pay me no mind, ser. Carry on as you like.
I don't know aught of dragons and such. I just do as I'm told.
This last round of talk has me well afraid. What's to become of us?

Entrance into the city is strictly prohibited. Unless you're with the convoy, of course.
They say the wyrm fled for the mountains, thank the Maker...
B-but that don't mean we throw wide the gate and let folks pass as they please. Who knows what other evils are out there?
State your business!
Who goes there!?
Where d'you think you're going?
Halt!
You'll go no farther!
M-my deepest apologies...
What brings you here, ser?
I cannot allow even the Arisen to pass unbidden.
I would thank you to refrain from such actions in the future, ser...
How little you know, Arisen!
Blessed destruction is nearly upon us! Soon, we shall all be saved!
Only through knowing chaos can the world be cleansed and reborn!
It is the only way for the world's salvation!
What do you think you're doing here?
...Why are you still in my presence?
What is your problem, friend?
May I have no respite from you?
I love intruders. Gives me a chance to work on my bladework.
Don't think I won't take the opportunity to put you in your place.
How can I be free of this clouted barnacle!?
I'd wager your head is even harder than my steel.
If all work were as slack as Arisening must be, I might've kept a legal job!
You may be the most mule-headed person I've ever met.
How go your travails?
Hallo!
Audacious harlots...spawned from the Dragon himself!
This really is the last straw, this time.
...For true?
Now...now is the time to strike, for true and for all.

Mm-hmm...

All the world's turned topsy-turvy...
Who could even...
I've a bad feeling, and it grows stronger every moment, no matter what I do.
'Tis one thing to fight a war man to man. But against beasts, much less one formidable as this...
This...this isn't what I signed up for...
Seems the duke has given you leave to enter the castle. Come this way.
None may enter the castle without permission.
No one may enter the castle at night.
Pawns are not allowed on castle grounds... Duke's orders.
This castle is the demesne of the duke himself. You will comport yourself appropriately at all times.
Violent, rambunctious, or otherwise unseemly actions are strictly forbidden.
If you cannot keep control of yourself, you'll be thrown into the dungeons until such time as you can.
Violence is not tolerated within the castle. You will be caught and punished, should you engage in such behavior.
Be you Arisen or the Maker himself, any act potentially endangering the duke is prohibited.
No one is allowed entrance to the castle at night. Keep track of your time accordingly.
Recently, a group of thieves were caught trying to tunnel into the castle grounds to steal royal treasures.
I would hate to think that the Arisen would be caught doing anything similar.
The duke has imposed various rules that everyone in the palace must follow.
I trust that you'll be able to follow them as well, Arisen. Details are posted on the notice board.
What do you think you're doing?
Brazen worm!
How dare you take such actions within the duke's palace!
Why you impudent--!
Arisen or no, expect no quarter in this matter.
Such flagrant rudeness... It's utterly deplorable!
Brash actions have harsh consequences... You'd best think on that.
Perhaps some time in here will keep you from making similar mistakes!
Escaped...
Thank you.
Arisen! Ser, I am fearsome loath to say it, but this gate has been sealed.
The order came to prevent brigands from flooding in amidst the chaos.
Pray, speed to the western gate. You will find entrance there!
Ambush!

Rumors swirl around the castle workman what was arrested.
He'll find no quarter from the Guard. Leaking secrets of state is a direct assault on the person of His Grace.
The duke's dungeons are a ghastly place... I wager he'll drown in a pool of his own blood ere long...
Our descent was slow work, and hard won... In the end, it claimed my master's life.
This place is home to fearsome creatures, ser. Take care...

Arisen... Hail, ser. It seems you truly stand apart from the rest of us.
Some sneered when I presented the hydra's head. Said it was your feat alone that won it.
In truth, I cannot deny it. I had no hand in it... 'Tis plain fact.
But what of the Enlistment Corps, then? What meaning does our fealty hold?
I have no answer to give my men... To give myself.
Pray, leave me. I fear I will be well drunk by eve's end.
Lookin' to bleed, are ye?
Bugger off!
What are you lookin' at?
Off with ye!
What is it?
I've naught to say to you.
If you've no business here, move on.
Best mind what you do here.
'Ow's the road treating you, cousin?
Come to join our little band?
Why are you here!?
Piss off!
Who d'you fancy you are?
You're not welcome here.
We don't suffer trespassers.
Eager to die, friend?
Be off with you!
You're daft, friend.
Have you naught better to do?
Still here, are you?
How do you fare?
Hoy!
Those rotten...
'Tis a poor jest...
...Truly?
We ought to have finished them earlier.
We'll do for them, we will...
Aye, we will...
What?
I see...
And what then?
Thanks, that's great!
If I try real hard, can I become Arisen too?
Arisen... I am glad to see you well.
We're yet uncertain of the cause of all that's happened. For now, finding those what survived comes first.
I worry for those in the castle, but alas, I cannot leave my post to see what's become of them.

Was that a hydra's head went by before? Whose prize was that, then? Ser Mercedes?
Was a time, and not long ago, such a beast would never spawn so close to Cassardis.
Could be the dragon's coming has their kind gone mad as well...
This here is Gran Soren's main gate.
She opens toward Cassardis, though I suspect you're well aware.
Out there, you face a hoard of beasts more hungered for blood than any I've seen...
In here, you find folk like that "Salvation" lot engaged in all manner of shadowy dealings.
It's got to a point I don't know which side's the safer.
You're of Cassardis, aren't you? D'you return there often?
Facing a dragon's hard enough without being kept from kith and kin. Or a lover, what's more.
There's few posts what's more tiresome than a sentry's. I say the same thing, day after day.
Times I wonder how I'm any different from a pawn.
'Tis my fault... I loosed a living monster upon the city.
Am I to die while standing here, doing the same dull task as ever?
I could take some pride, at least, if I thought this gate might hold the dragon...
The city's half in ruins, but here I am, standing at the gate, saying the same thing as ever.
I thought it senseless for a while, but now it almost feels a source of pride.
Uh!
Guh!
Wauuugh...
Hmph!
Hraah!
Hoy there.
Fare well.
Aye.
Naw.
My thanks.
This just beats all.
You know of the duke's manse across the gulf from Gran Soren, yes?
Business of a sort led me to that estate in times past.
But foul creatures stir in the wake of the dragon's arrival. I'd not venture there now for ten sacks of gold.
Are you familiar with the curious hill on the way from here to the manse?
That which bears the image of a man writ large?
A queer fellow spends his hours on that hill, day and night, just staring off...
The common folk name him "the Fool of the Henge", mostlike due to his ravings.
But no need to fear the Hilltop Halfwit -- seeing you brought him to mind, is all.
Me? Oh, no one of import, ser. Just a humble messenger is all.
Time was I could run here to the manse and back in a single sun. But age has settled in my bones, and such days are long behind me.
Time was, the duke would hold the most fantastic balls at the manse...
But that was back when His Grace was...of a healthier temperament. Time works a cruel magick on even the greatest of us, eh?
I've not always been the old man you see before you. I was once hailed as the greatest messenger in all Gransys.
They named me Maurin the Quick, and sang of my deeds in every keep and alehouse.
There was even a time, you know, I spent my nights at the manse, stealing kisses from a nobleman's daughter.
There's a secret corridor to the place, you see. Just the thing for late-night mischief.
My steps have slowed, but I've some messenger yet left in me.
Even Duke Edmun himself yet avails himself of my service.
And so I remain, on the job until the day I deliver my final message.
Some days I wonder what the final message of Maurin the Quick will be...
Perhaps my last missive may be glad tidings of the dragon's defeat?
Or perhaps sad news of Duke Edmun's demise? If not one, then the other, I imagine...
This just beats all.
Mind how you dress 'round these parts. You'd best consider something more respectable.
That's enough.
You'll find naught but the manses of wealthy folk past here.
Well, I suppose there could be some among them might have work for the Arisen.
A guardsman's wage is hardly worth the danger.
I'm not paid near enough to guard the city from the likes of a dragon.
Might be time I took to running...
D'you suppose there's any hope for Gransys?
The thought of Valmiro setting out<cf>again... 'Tis a worry.
I pray Valmiro's travels add up to more<cf>than collapsing on some roadside again...
Let us bring Valmiro what he asks, as a<cf>parting gift.
The least we can do is furnish Valmiro<cf>with what he needs.
You recall Valmiro's request, Arisen?
With a healthy stock of healing items for<cf>his travels, Valmiro needn't worry.
The man's a magnet for trouble. We'd<cf>best provide plenty of healing items.
'Twas a supply of healing items Valmiro<cf>wanted.
Valmiro asked for aught to light his way.
Best we gift him something to ward off<cf>the darkness.
Tireless as he is heedless, he'll be<cf>exploring by night. He'll be needing light.
He'll not get far without ample provisions<cf>to eat.
A man cannot adventure on an empty<cf>belly. He'll be needing plenty to eat.
That ought to suffice.<cf>Valmiro will be pleased.
'Tis a goodly amount.<cf>Let's get those herbs to Valmiro.
Valmiro would like rest easier with a<cf>few more herbs...
We'd best provide a few more herbs.
A lantern will let Valmiro travel<cf>day and night. Let's bring him one.
Let's bring that lantern to Valmiro.
Best we give that to Valmiro.<cf>He'll be needing provisions.
That will help keep Valmiro in his travels.
He's like to forget food, starry-eyed<cf>as he is... Best we see to it ourselves.
Traveling alone can be trying...<cf>Mayhap a charm would ease his mind.
Indeed, a charm could help keep his<cf>spirits up.
Valmiro seeks some manner of charm to<cf>take with him.
Perhaps he's right, and a charm will<cf>bring him fortune in his travels?
Valmiro will be most pleased.
Let's hurry that charm to Valmiro, Arisen.
That should keep him, aye?
Shall we see to his luggage?
We'll make quick work of it if we divvy<cf>up the load.
'Tis quite a bit of luggage...<cf>Not too much, I hope?
Buy it with coin in the markets, or with<cf>steel in the catacombs; 'tis your choice.
I fear I have misjudged the extent of your skill,<cf>dear Arisen.
I see it was folly to worry of walls and<cf>armies while you still live!
However...
It seems my regret will be short-lived.
Don't you feel it? The very air dances around us! 
The long night is come!
The dragon's reign at last begins!
Merciful winged death!
All-powerful and merciless Grigori!
Behold, you unrepentant blasphemers!
This is absolute truth!
THIS IS SALVATIO--
The rantings of an upjumped zealot<cf>make for tedious listening.
His ilk serves no role in what is to come.
Only my death will stanch the flood of destruction... 
A task still far beyond your means.
If you would face me, seek me out and I shall allow it.
But heed the zealot's lesson well--
When the weak court death, they find it.
Until then, I shall hold your little keepsake safe.
Your "Dragonforged" will speak for my diligence in that.
The choice falls not to me, nor to the whims of fate...
It is yours alone.
You! Had you ne'er come, I would yet rule this land...
I knew neither age nor the sting of death while the dragon yet drew breath...
But you, you covetous wretch! You wanted eternal life for your own, and my title what's more!
You took the dragon's bargain! You sold your love to death in exchange for glory!
The beast promised you my seat if you slew me, is that it? Eh!?
Well, you'll not have it. You'll ne'er have it!
I'll not give it up. Not to you! I'll rot afore I see Gransys bow to you!
How fared your audience with His Grace, Arisen?
Aldous Ludric Sorn, at your service, ser. I serve as a chamberlain in the duke's court.
As you may have seen for yourself, it seems His Grace is unwell.
In truth, there is worry enough to make any man's head ache, but I fear he ails of worse than worry.
Perhaps I ought not speak further on the matter, for my own wellbeing...
I am charged with assigning Royal Orders, tasks of great import issued by the duke himself.
Pray, forgive the bother, but I ask that you come see me here in the castle whenever circumstances allow you to take on assignment.
The future of this war is murky, ser. May your efforts help to bring its end into sight.
Keep watch for falling rocks on the path ahead, Captain.
This pass is a nest for every manner of foul beast, Ser Arisen.
No man can say where they'll strike from. Pray, be careful.
Well, let us be done with it, I say.
No... We'll not hold it!
Hail, brother.
Naught to report?
Who is that!?
An impostor!

No, I think not.

Ohh, you have my thanks, dear.
Fancy a look?
Take all the time you need.
Ohh, that's a good one.
Always a pleasure, dear.
I'll be waiting for you.
I'm afraid not, dear.
How about this?
I'll hold onto it.
Here, this is the one.
All right.
No, no, no!
What is it you need?
Forgive me, dear, but I've not the time.
There's aught twisted in this world of ours.
Know any tales to brighten the day?
Augh, all this worry is murder on my back.
The duke's men are doing the best they're able...
Augh, what's to happen to us now...?
The fear just feeds upon itself...
Augh, what's to happen to us now...?
Fancy a look?
Ohh, you have my thanks, dear.
A griffin!?

Hnh!
Eagh!
Well met, ser.
By your leave...
Yes.
No.
You have my thanks.
I thank you from the depths of my heart.
Is there aught I may assist you in?
Pardon, ser, but I fear I haven't the time.
We must all of us endeavor to remain calm and resolute.
Action taken in haste often yields dire results.
We shall do as His Grace commands.
The people's hearts grow cold and stony. Pray, take care.
The conflict spreads each day... 'Tis a grave shame.
The Maker is wroth... But why? Why...?
I thank you from the depths of my heart.
This place is a hive for all manner of beasts.
Stay vigilant, ser.
I'll have my vengeance, beast!
Pawns? What of them? Don't know nothing, nor do I care to. Ask someone else!
What? I've no time for talk of pawns. Go pester the innkeep!
I'm a sentry, not a guide. Ask at the inn.
I must tend to my watch, ser. If you've a question, pray ask at the inn.
The road will be closed a while. If you've nowhere else to go, wait at the inn.
Do I look a pawn to you? Go bother someone else.
'Tis selfish to beg a favor in such times, I know, but there is aught I would ask your help in.
Might we speak a moment...privately?
Accept
Not now
My thanks. 'Tis a...sensitive matter. I would ask your discretion.
In the wake of the dragon's coming, many of the villagers have come to offer prayers.
As a novice and a newcomer, I welcome the chance to be of use, but...my scriptures are missing.
I have yet to commit the verses to memory. Without the text, I...I cannot offer up proper prayer.
The scriptures were secure in the chapel last I saw them. I do not wish to believe them stolen...
If you come upon them, pray, see them back to me? I would be ever in your debt.
I... I see. Of course. I am sorry to have troubled you.
I am newly come, and eager to become a part of this place. I wish to be of service.
But now, just as others have come to rely upon me... 'Tis a shameful failure on my part.
I cannot think the scriptures far gone. Pray, help me to look around the area.
The scriptures! You've found them! Oh, Maker be praised...
I cannot thank you enough. Truly, the people of Cassardis are a goodhearted bunch.
Now I can once more offer proper prayer on behalf of the village.
But I've dallied long enough -- there is work for me to do!
I am impressed.
I'll be damned...<cf>This your handiwork, for truth?
What is the likes of a hydra doing here, anyway? 
Ancient tales of the Arisen are well and good, friend...
But make a gift of this head to the duke...
and you might earn yourself a real title.
Off With Its Head
Under Mercedes' command, you set off across<cf>the mountains for the capital of Gran Soren<cf>to present the hydra's head to the duke.

We cannot lower our guard for a second.
Careful, Master...<cf>There are cutthroats about.
We're marked for death. Stay watchful.
These Nameless Men are a shadowy lot,<cf>apt to appear anywhere...
I've a bad feeling of this place...
They caught us unawares...<cf>'Twas a close thing.
Their next attack hangs over us<cf>like a cloud...
We cannot rest while they yet hunt us.
Even here...
'Tis ended.
The Nameless Men are no more.
Bandits roam these lands. Keep your<cf>wits about you.
This place is still warm with human<cf>presence... They're near...
'Tis quiet. More so than it ought be.
Let them live now and we'll be plagued<cf>hence. This ends here!
Ready yourself, Arisen. I feel eyes upon us.
Best we return at night.
Arisen, the vanguard marches on the<cf>dragon's abode. Let us hurry and join them!
They need our help, master!
We ought to be safe here for the<cf>moment. Still, press on with care...
A gateway to the rift, here?<cf>Arisen, go and touch that stone.
This pawn is yours to command,<cf>Arisen.
We are come from another world to serve<cf>you, Arisen, deathless and unfearing.
We shall join you, master.<cf>Onward, to the den of the wyrm.
'Tis an open space ahead. I hear<cf>beasts...and wingbeats! Ready yourself!
I have a bad feeling about this...
Survivors! Let's join them!
Horrible... I'll strike a light.
The dragon's roost is just beyond.<cf>We should hurry.
The bones of still more soldiers...<cf>How awful...
This one yet lives!
A survivor!
I fear there's naught we can<cf>do for them now...
It's...it's beyond imagining...
Not far to the dragon's roost now.
It shows itself!
A show of confidence?
We'd best see to Madeleine's safety.
All prepared to escort her, Arisen?
The woman flits about like a drunken<cf>bee...
Safe and sound.
Here we are, safely arrived.
Follow the road and we'll be at the<cf>encampment in a trice.
The road to the encampment is short.<cf>We need only keep vigilant.
She's certainly...willful.
'Tis no mean feat to play escort to<cf>this one...
Flightier than a songbird, this girl...
Very...spirited, that woman.
Let us leave this place.
Not as if I ever wanted to see down that cursed well in the first place...
But I fled, and from one fear right into another!
Why in the Maker's name did I become a soldier?
Do you mock me, ser? Do you think me craven?
Soldiers are yet men, and we suffer the ills and frailties of men.
To die without purpose accomplishes nothing. Any who say otherwise sacrifice sense for bravery.
D'you suppose there's any hope for Gransys?
What can we do but hope the Maker preserves us?
What, you forgot? Ah, 'tis done now anyway.
'Tis a nightmare come real...
His Grace will deliver us from the dragon, see if he doesn't.
That's why we pay the man taxes, eh?
I'm a city fellow, I am. Won't catch me out working the fields, oh no.
No, I'll take life safe within Gran Soren's sturdy walls, thank you.
Walls my taxes built, mind.
The Duke's men are all about, pressing folk into service to fight off the dragon.
Me, I bought my way out.
You won't catch me marching off to die, oh no.
The beast took the Greatwall!?
But, solid stone... That wall is as thick as I am tall, twice over!
If the damn thing doesn't serve its purpose, why did my taxes go to build it in the first place!?
That chasm swallowed up near half the city...
Maker only knows what tax they'll squeeze from us to fix it...
'Tis locked. You haven't the key to fit it...
'Tis caught on something. Perhaps it could open from the far side.
'Tis barred shut. Might be able to break the bolt.
'Tis shut tight.
'Tis no use at this hour. You'll have to come again later.
Best stop for now.
Seems they're closed.
Someone was here...
Lost them...
Gone...
Perhaps you've upset them.
There's naught to do here.
Best you moved on.
Not here...
The door is closed.
Shows no sign of opening.
There's aught there...
You don't see anything.
That smell...
Someone's near...
What's this...?
Fine view from here.
There's aught written here...
Must be a way to find something...
Smells delicious.
Perfect spot to place something.
You can almost reach...
There appears to be aught ahead.
That fall could kill.
'Tis dangerous to touch.
A strong blow might break it.
Perhaps if you came by night.
Perhaps if you came by day.
Perhaps if you came at dawn.
Perhaps if you came at dusk.
There's aught buried here...
You see no way up.
'Tis slick, this spot.
No use pressing any further.
No need to double back further.
No time for that now.
You cannot carry any more.
There may yet be aught lying about.
Seems there's naught you can take on at present.<cf>Best to try again later.
Perhaps with a bit of help...
Best you kept your weapon sheathed.
Is someone here...?
'Tis a place for tall folk.
'Tis a place for small folk.
Had you a woman in your band...
Had you a man in your band...
Had you a strong companion...
Had you a swift companion...
Had you a magick user...
Had you an apt climber...
Had you a skilled jumper...
This weapon will not help you.
That armor won't protect you.
You're ill equipped for this.
Seems it can't be used now.
You'll get no further use from it.
'Tis useless, now.
Hmm, not with your current equipment...
Not with your current party...
You hear aught from further in.
Enemies... They're close.
Best you got some rest.
You can carry no more!
You're too exhausted!
"Danger! Keep Out!"
"No Trespassing"
A sign.
Had you an Empty Flask, you might fill it here.
You'll get no further without a lantern.
'Tis dangerous to fumble about in the dark. Best find a light.
Best not just leave them.
If aught were left here, it would rot.
Best take care you don't get lost.
Best check the map.
You're due for a rest.
This place is dangerous by night.
This place is dangerous by day.
Breathtaking...
You'll get no further!
Seems you'll need to come back.
Nothing left here.
It looks fit to crumble.
Seems it could be moved...
It will not budge.
It will not open.
Seems you need a key.
Seems you need a Pickaxe here.
You yet lack the experience.
You yet lack the skill.
Not with your current vocation...
You'll not pass through this gate.
You've no time!
Seems you were too late.
You may make it, yet.
You're doing well for time.
Seems you've come at the wrong time.
There may be another path.
'Tis a powerful weapon... Too bad it doesn't work.
Something strong can be sensed from the stone. It <cf>appears the memories of someone have been etched<cf>upon the surface of the Monument of Remembrance.
Heh, I suppose you think it's easy work, standing watch? That we just amble about the grounds?
Truth told, you'd be right.
Thanks to the dragon, the castle's all but empty. The city, too. Gran Soren's grown quiet.
Lucky thing I wasn't posted to the Greatwall.
I'm glad to hear tell of that mess from a safe distance.
The Greatwall's near the Fetor, too. All the more likely to come across the dragon.
If the Greatwall's fallen, it's but a matter of time before Gran Soren is struck.
Perhaps it was a fool's hope that stone and mortar might hold the beast.
In the end, there's naught we can do but pray for another Edmun Dragonsbane.
Hail, Arisen! Looking dour as ever, I see.
I've a proposal that might put some cheer in those cheeks. Will you hear me?
Hear her out
Not now
Well, it's like this: A peddler is only as good as her suppliers.
For my own part, being both clever and beautiful, I've little trouble keeping an inventory...
But contentment leads to failure, so I seek new weaponsmiths to supply my shop.
I have a certain one in mind: A man of singular talent, but caustic temperament. Much as you, in truth!
The smith refuses audience with all but select clients.
And upon such clients he bestows an idol, so as to prove his favor.
If I can recover such a figurine, I would have singular right to peddle his wares in these parts.
There is no cost I will not bear to gain this icon.
So what say you, Arisen? Will you retrieve an idol for me?
This is a job most suited to your talents; I pray you will not fail me in it.
Ah, it pains me to hear that. The offer could well have served us both.
My earlier proposal yet stands. Will you not hear it?
Hear her out
Not now
As to where you might happen upon a figurine, I know not.
As they are meant for the weaponsmith and his patrons, you might speak with one such as them?
You should bear in mind the idol may come in several different forms...
Maker knows why the smith does so, but that's as the stories tell.
Ah, an idol! Wonderful!
I was right to trust in you for this.
An icon bestowed upon only the most valued customers...
It bears a curious look...almost mystical, would you agree?
An icon bestowed upon only the most valued customers...
I daresay it's a work of art itself.
This is the icon bestowed upon only the most valued of customers? I expected something more...impressive.
The weaponsmith will see me now, and no delay. What a coup for my humble shop! 
You've done me a great service, Arisen. I shall plan to repay the favor when next I receive new inventory.
Until then, may the Maker guide your steps!
This icon is bestowed upon only the most valued of customers, yes? In truth, I thought to find it...different somehow.
Well enough! It's no matter.
The weaponsmith will see me now, and no delay. What a coup for my humble shop! 
You've done me a great service, Arisen. I shall plan to repay the favor when next I receive new inventory.
Until then, may the Maker guide your steps!
You are blind to the truth, Arisen!
Perdition is nigh! The hour of redemption is upon us!
All will burn, and through fire return to nothingness!
In the name of Salvation, the world must know chaos. The world must know destruction!
I'd not believe such villainy could be found in Cassardis had I not been a victim myself.
The scoundrel even uncovered my hidden stores. I'd told no one of them...
'Tis clear the felon is no common cutpurse, but a thief of<cf>considerable skill. We must put a stop to him.
Damn!
Shh! Keep silent!
Now! Go!
Hngh!
What orders for me, Arisen?
What is your wish, Arisen?
If there is aught this pawn can do,<cf>merely say the word.
Speak your wishes unto me, Arisen.
I am yours to command, Arisen.
Simply ask, and this pawn shall obey.
I shy from no challenge in battle,<cf>and seek out the strongest opponents.
I am cautious in battle, and ever<cf>mindful of self-preservation.
I seek out the most vulnerable targets,<cf>dropping them one by one.
I've a mind for stratagems, and work to flank<cf>opponents to ensure their speedy demise.
As a tactical fighter, I undermine the<cf>enemy's status to hasten their downfall.
Arisen, I make your safety my utmost priority<cf>in combat.
My fellow pawns are my greatest concern in<cf>battle. When they fall, I am there to aid them.
I am a curious sort, and prone to exploring.
I've a great love of treasure. I'm ever on<cf>the watch for items of value on the field.
I have an eye for medicine, and am<cf>quick to find healing supplies in combat.
As an avid collector of materials, I am<cf>ever harvesting supplies, even in combat.
Does this please you, Arisen?
I fear I've nothing to ask you at present.

Arisen. I would speak with you...privately.
Hear him out
Not now
This is not the place. 'Tis a conversation best had after dark.
Meet me in the courtyard by night.
I'll know not to expect overmuch from the Arisen in the future.
I shall await you in the castle courtyard after dark. ...Tell no one of your coming.
Ah, you've come. You must forgive me the secrecy.
The matter demands it, I assure you. I dare not speak it aloud, so pray, listen close.
Truth be told, I have long traveled the land in secret, keeping watch over the duke's army. Now I fear my investigation has borne fruit...
One company has amassed supplies far beyond their need. Their regimen of training, too, defies comparison.
His Grace must know of this, thought I, and so drafted a letter to send the moment I found a courier I could trust.
But fate is cruel, ser, and the pack I'd placed the letter was snatched by monsters out on the roads.
If someone should find that missive, and its contents become known to the public, morale will crumble.
What's more, a secret serves use only so long as it stays hidden. Their treason will be more easily foiled if they do not expect the duke to know of it.
The letter must be found. Surely you understand, ser?
I would ask you to find it and retrieve it here to me.
Naturally, His Grace cannot openly compensate you for this task, but I shall gladly pay you of my own pockets should you succeed. Maker speed your steps, ser.
I was traveling the roads when I was attacked. Came from the air, swooping down long enough to snatch up my pack.
Like as not carried it back to their nest, though where that may be, I know not...
The mountains near the Greatwall are nest to many a flying creature, though. Perhaps there is the best place to start.
What of the letter, ser?
My every hope goes with you.
Still no sign of the letter, then? Your reputation suggests a more expedient hand...
I'll know not to expect overmuch from the Arisen in the future.
That seal... You've found the letter!
And the seal is yet unbroken. Good, its contents remain a secret.
I shall give it to His Grace myself at the earliest chance.
You are a wonder, ser. I shall see that you are properly rewarded for this boon.
No letter...? Bah, enough, then. 'Tis too late, now. Far too late...
And the seal is yet unbroken. Good, its contents remain a secret.
This pawn feels its presence...
'Tis close... No, farther now. But present. Ever present!

'Tis well and truly flooded.
To relight a wet lantern, remove it, then<cf>withdraw it anew.
Then you have come... Very well, Arisen.
I am Grigori, devourer of a thousand worlds, nemesis of five hundred score Arisen.
Lay your pitiable life at my feet!
Cede your life to me...
Accept your fate.
Arisen... I know you well.
You would rise against me once more?
And so it e'er shall be...
You are not worthy.
You... Truly, you are worthy...
Even I cannot stay you...
Go, and face what lies beyond...
Madness calls, my puppet...
Ah, fortune smiles upon me. Well met, Ser Arisen.
I'm called Mason, if it please you.
Now you're come to the capital a conquering hero, you'll be needing aught to do, eh?
My word to you: begin with the pawns. Inquire about them here in Gran Soren.
Their kind's woven tight into the fate of the Arisen. If you'd know your destiny, know them.
I've got another matter to discuss with you, in time, but we'll save that for another day, eh?
I look forward to it, friend.
Oh, worry not. That other matter will keep, friend.
Ah, say, friend, have you chanced upon a strange old man of late? Shady mien, queer mumblings...?
They call him the Elysion. A name I hear far too oft, these days...
Well, keep the man in mind. I've business with him myself...
Seems you're at the center of the storm, Arisen.
Or perhaps it's you that's spinning the rest of us about...
Nh.
Mnnh.
Gwaaaugh...
Hah!
Eagh!
Yes?
By your leave.
Yes.
I fear not.
...I thank you.
You've earned my thanks.
Well met, ser. Julien of Meloire, at your service.
I command a battalion in the Wyrm Hunt, but let us be quit of ranks and titles.
I am but a man sent by a concerned neighbor to help.
Then you are the Arisen...?
I hear tell you command the pawn legion. The Hunt is lucky to have such an ally.
I owe you an apology, ser.
I confess dismissing talk of Arisen with the other old tales I heard at my nurse's teat.
But your actions leave little room for doubt. I am impressed.
The duke's soldiers are a hopelessly unwieldy lot. It takes an age to prepare for anything.
What use is pomp and ceremony when it keeps us from the frontlines where we are needed?
Sadly my position in the court affords me little say in such matters.
It makes a man grateful for agile allies. I envy your freedom, ser.
The wyrm has shown itself.
We remain woeful short of men, but the beast isn't like to wait for us.
I'll be off to face it soon myself, no doubt...
Pity me, Arisen, for I lack the weight of legend to steel me for the challenge.
I face the dragon with no sane hope of slaying it.
Perchance we'll meet again, should the Maker see fit to spare us both.
Until then, fare well, ser.
A ring? You mean me to wear it?
Do you quite realize the meaning of such an act, ser?
...I'll not decline it, mind. A favor from the Arisen is a great honor indeed.
My thanks.
As I think on it now, 'tis a funny thing...
Just what am I come here to do?
Until now, I have acted for my homeland and its people.
I well know others would brand me a villain, but I have e'er followed a knight's path, as I see it.
But now...
Having stood betwixt you and the dragon, I am humbled.
Yours was a struggle far above the petty matters I've long concerned myself with.
The wyrm exists beyond diplomacy and intrigue, unbound by oath or expectation. As do you.
You've given me cause to see how miniscule, how insignificant I truly was, though I bear you no ill will for it.
Nay, I thank you. I thank you and watch on with eager interest where your journey takes you next.
Oh.
Ohh!
Ooough...
Hoh.
Taaah!
We meet again, friend.
We'll speak again soon, you and I.
Aye, I s'pose so.
Now there you're mistaken.
My thanks.
My, my, my... Very generous indeed.
That curious about me, are you?
I'd be flattered if I weren't too busy to stay and speak.
Another time, though...
My, this is a curious place to meet.
What brings me here? A personal errand, friend.
At times a fellow can find aught of real worth hidden amid the grime of the aqueduct.
What say you? Care to join me in the mud?
Ah, happy coincidence to find you here, Arisen.
Shrewder than I'd thought you, Arisen. And here I believed it when you offered your help...
As you'll like know by now, my aim is to learn the designs of a certain society...
I've about enough information gathered to pick up and head home.
Another strange coincidence, friend.
Seems a lady friend of yours is eager to become acquainted with the organization I serve...
We share a certain bond by now, you and I. I'm not beyond giving the girl an introduction, should the opportunity arise.
Like as not, she'll need it. There are as many youths who wish to train at the Cathedral as there are grains of sand in your little village.
That girl newly come to the abbey certainly holds you in her trust, eh friend? Heh heh...
Trust's a tricky thing. Not for the craven, that much is sure.
My, my, my... Very generous indeed.
If you've no business here, begone!
Nothing to see here, move along.
This posting was a fool's errand from the start...
Errand for the duke, is it?
You'll go alone. The pawns stay.
The Conspirators
Chamberlain Fedel would task you with a mission...<cf>One regarding a certain important item that could<cf>greatly influence his work in the palace.

Search Near the Greatwall
Head to the Greatwall, and search the area<cf>for signs of the missing letter.



Valmiro, eh? I've not seen him today, though not long past we spoke about creatures of the sea.
Well, in truth, he spoke. I mostly made a show of listening. 
Perhaps you'll find the lad on the shore? Worth a visit, I'd warrant.
Uh!
Guh!
Waaaugh...
Hah!
Taah!
Hoy!
Take care.
Aye.
No.
Kind of you.
Thank you, goodfisher.
We lost Cortese and Rickard...
Our brothers deserve vengeance, but what hope is there of that?
None for me, at least. One look at the beast and my legs fell out from under me...
Some terror, that dragon, eh?
I hear tell you've already made a name for yourself at the encampment.
You work fast, eh?
I'd always thought you a bit different from the others. Now I see it's true.
You were meant for grander things than fishing, my friend.
Is there aught sense to lingering on here?
I like Cassardis fine, but what's the use of learning to fix boats when the dragon's fit to come any day?
I may not be quite the hero you are, but surely there's aught I could be doing to help.
Hearing talk of all that ails the land, I want to help, somehow...
But how?
What!? You met the duke? In person!?
What an honor!
D'you think there's hope a fellow like me could fare as well as you if I set out now?
Taking orders straight from the duke now, eh? You're a hero to the land.
I am envious. How does a fellow become like you, I wonder?
I knew you were different.
From the moment I saw you stand your ground against the dragon, I knew.
For a time, I thought to make myself in your image. Follow your example...
But I know now that's a vain hope.
To the very end, there was naught I could do... But that's as it should be.
My lot is here, training under the foreman.
It's where I belong. What I was meant for.
I am envious. How does a fellow become like you, I wonder?
Thank you, goodfisher.
Welcome, Arisen. 'Tis an honor to have you come so far to meet us.
Are you here seeking the source of the skeletons, or have you just come to rid us of a few traitors? My thanks, by the by.
I see no call for secrets. It was Salvation loosed those bone warriors upon the land. They are...an experiment... A vanguard.
All in preparation for the day of reckoning to come.
You shall have an honored place among them,<cf>Arisen.
Aye, your bones shall lead the march as the red dawn breaks!
Graaaugh!
All things...to ash...
None would believe Gran Soren held<cf>such a place beneath it...
Well deep, this place. Just how far<cf>does it go...?
Such massive ruins... Who could<cf>have fashioned them?
We may be within Gran Soren, but this<cf>place holds monsters just the same.
I cannot but feel we pawns bear<cf>some connection to this place.
'Tis a lever controls this door, Master.
We'll go no further till we find<cf>the switch what opens this door.
The door's switch is this way.
This single lever controls all the doors.
Seems using this lever affects<cf>every door in the ruins at once.
Looks as what doors were closed stand<cf>open, and those once open are closed.
There is a path leading off this<cf>way as well.
There's a trick door within. Come,<cf>follow me.
'Tis a lever.
This place hides something...<cf>Shall we take a look?
This way!
"Begin with the pawns..."<cf>What could he mean by that?
Perhaps we should visit the inn.
The innkeep may be able to shed<cf>some light.
They hardly seem cooperative. Mayhap<cf>the innkeep's tongue is looser?
Where is this guild for pawns?
The guild lies at the city's west<cf>end.
Let's make for the Pawn Guild.<cf>'Tis on the west side of Gran Soren.
If you would know more of we pawns,<cf>make for the Pawn Guild.
They say the Pawn Guild lies in the<cf>Craftsman's Quarter.
Lost, Master?
'Tis a city new to us, and vast. Shall<cf>we explore a bit?
When do you suppose the guards will<cf>let us past?
We'd best ask around about the pawn<cf>legion.
If we want information, we'll have to<cf>ask around.
There -- the inn. Perhaps they can<cf>tell us something.
Seems the west gate's open.
I recall the Pawn Guild being nearby.
This square houses an inn. Shall we<cf>begin our search there?
I'm near certain the Pawn Guild can<cf>be found up ahead.
Might we ask the locals of the Pawn<cf>Guild?
We'll find what we seek just ahead.
Now, let's have a look about and find<cf>this guild.
The Pawn Guild is west of here,<cf>Master, through the gate.
A woman called Sara has aided me in<cf>the past. She'd likely help us.
Caxton was thankful -- a good man to have in our debt.
Caxton was less than overjoyed, but his business will profit all the same.
There is a hierarchy of icons.<cf>Best find the best we can.
This must be it!
Let's set about to finding this idol, then.
We need that figurine to win the<cf>smithy's trust.
Perhaps giving Madeleine a fine idol<cf>will earn us a discount.
We may earn a golden idol from its<cf>owner in return for a favor...
Who do you suppose holds a golden idol?
Fournival holds a golden icon...<cf>Let's make for Gran Soren.
Perform a favor for Fournival and we<cf>may earn that golden idol.
We're close, mark my words...
Shall we look for more?
We've already an idol, Master.<cf>Need we find them all?
A silver idol is nearby.
Were it gold, she'd have been happier still.
Thus you tread the path of all true Arisen:<cf>To face the dragon...and learn the real truth.
Though I called you here to me, it was ever your own feet, your own will that brought you.
And now again, the choice is yours, Arisen.
Offer up the life of your beloved, here and now, and you shall live as sovereign of this land.
Your heart will remain ever in my safekeeping, and with it your mortality.
Or, if you would stand against me now, as at the outset of your journey, I shall allow it.
Take up your tiny barbs of steel and fight. I shall respond with the all of my being.
You would face me, then? 'Tis a fool's choice, Arisen.
But better fool than craven. I knew your mind ere you came...
Still, I ask this final time. Arisen, will you stand and fight?
Yes
No
Then you will renounce your bond with this human and make an offering of their death?
I shall not judge you, Arisen, for weakness is your nature as a child of man.
I ask this final time. Will you turn and leave this place?
Yes
No
Your choice is made, Arisen! As you have willed it, so shall it be!
Doubt still holds you... Very well. We have time, you and I.
Show me your power, Arisen. Awaken now in full!
Still my heart and lay open the path beyond.
This is not fate, nor duty's call. This battle is your own, waged of your own free will.
Aye, reclaim that which you have lost...
Take back your life... The surge of blood that tethers you to this world...
It awaits you, Arisen, yearning here within me...
The hour for turning back is past. The world will have its answer: you or me? Death, or life beyond?
If you would gain aught, give your all here and now! Such is the contest you have chosen!
Have you come so far to be stricken with cowardice, Arisen? You have chosen your path!
There is naught beyond this moment for those who will not give themselves whole to their cause.
Hollow vessel in the form of man, heed the will of your new master...
Yes... I remember now. This sensation, this pain... I know it well.
This battle is mine, just as it is yours. It is aught I began long ago!
A false hope, fallen short...
Then I must seek another ready to awaken... Ready to walk the path to its end.
'Tis the will of the master that shapes the soulless pawn.
You've trained them well, Arisen.
Aye, raise your weapon... Your teeth of steel, your blood-red voice...
Show me your power, Arisen! Prove yourself worthy of what lies beyond my corpse!
Show that you possess the strength to still my heart. The will to do it. The soul!
Slay me, and with me death itself. Stay the fires of destruction!
This battle you have begun sits at the very heart of all creation.
We are the axis about which the world turns, Arisen. Time itself flows with your footsteps!
'Tis the will of the master that shapes the soulless pawn.
You've trained them well, Arisen.
Yes, this fire! This pain!
The hurt you visit upon me is the selfsame pain I once inflicted!
Come, Arisen...
If you are truly awakened unto the world, you shall weather the fires of perdition unscathed!
Surpass me, if you would truly be the one to take up the endless chain.
Show that you possess power fit to best me, or your world is forfeit unto ruin.
And by your own choosing, what is more.
The one you refused to offer up shall die as sure as the rest.
To'oh, puro'oga...
Ghuria, figo...
Fetha, mo'oldo septa! 
If you lack the strength to stay my fire...to stay the fated ruin...
Then all shall scatter as ash.
Now, come, Arisen!
Heed well this place, Arisen.
Know the frailty of the works of man.
This hold once stood proud and firm...
'Twas the fool's decision of a man too weak brought it down.
Fight! Cling to life!
Hmph.
Pitiable wingless human...return to the earth!
Your life...
Your very heart rests here within me...
Gwaugh!
Y-you...! Heart...!?
Graaaaough!
Gwaugh...
'Tis locked. You haven't the key to fit it...
'Tis caught on something. Perhaps it could open from the far side.
'Tis barred shut. Might be able to break the bolt.
'Tis shut tight.
'Tis no use at this hour. You'll have to come again later.
Best stop for now.
Seems they're closed.
Someone was here...
Lost them...
Gone...
Perhaps you've upset them.
There's naught to do here.
Best you moved on.
Not here...
The door is closed.
Shows no sign of opening.
There's aught there...
You don't see anything.
That smell...
Someone's near...
What's this...?
Fine view from here.
There's aught written here...
Must be a way to find something...
Smells delicious.
Perfect spot to place something.
You can almost reach...
There appears to be aught ahead.
That fall could kill.
'Tis dangerous to touch.
A strong blow might break it.
Perhaps if you came by night.
Perhaps if you came by day.
Perhaps if you came at dawn.
Perhaps if you came at dusk.
There's aught buried here...
You see no way up.
'Tis slick, this spot.
No use pressing any further.
No need to double back further.
No time for that now.
You cannot carry any more.
There may yet be aught lying about.
Seems there's naught you can take on at present.<cf>Best to try again later.
Perhaps with a bit of help...
Best you kept your weapon sheathed.
Is someone here...?
'Tis a place for tall folk.
'Tis a place for small folk.
Had you a woman in your band...
Had you a man in your band...
Had you a strong companion...
Had you a swift companion...
Had you a magick user...
Had you an apt climber...
Had you a skilled jumper...
This weapon will not help you.
That armor won't protect you.
You're ill equipped for this.
Seems it can't be used now.
You'll get no further use from it.
'Tis useless, now.
Hmm, not with your current equipment...
Not with your current party...
You hear aught from further in.
Enemies... They're close.
Best you got some rest.
You can carry no more!
You're too exhausted!
"Danger! Keep Out!"
"No Trespassing"
A sign.
Had you an Empty Flask, you might fill it here.
You'll get no further without a lantern.
'Tis dangerous to fumble about in the dark. Best find a light.
Best not just leave them.
If aught were left here, it would rot.
Best take care you don't get lost.
Best check the map.
You're due for a rest.
This place is dangerous by night.
This place is dangerous by day.
Breathtaking...
You'll get no further!
Seems you'll need to come back.
Nothing left here.
It looks fit to crumble.
Seems it could be moved...
It will not budge.
It will not open.
Seems you need a key.
Seems you need a Pickaxe here.
You yet lack the experience.
You yet lack the skill.
Not with your current vocation...
You'll not pass through this gate.
You've no time!
Seems you were too late.
You may make it, yet.
You're doing well for time.
Seems you've come at the wrong time.
There may be another path.
People lived here, once. There may be aught here still.
A sign...

A curious place, this...
This place feels strange...
This tree alone lives on.
The water's edge is dangerous. Best not go too far.
A calming breeze blows in from the sea.
The wyrm reduced most of the fishing boats to tinder...
Destroyed by monsters then abandoned, most like.
Remnants of some lost building.
Inhabited, once... Seems it's been abandoned some time.
The treasure's in sight, but out of reach...
'Tis massive...
You can't get out!
A grand cascade...
You'd like have a good view from the top.
Abandoned, most like... She's taking on water, now.
A trip wire. Best tread carefully here...
The sound of the brook is music to your weary<cf>soul.
Remnant of a hold, most like. Only this wall stands now...
'Tis quite comfortable inside.
A dead end. You'll have to turn back.
The water's clouded with mud.
Ah, a welcome fire...
Rather barren...
Must be poor drainage...
Must have been a lake here, to judge from the lay of the land.
"Abbey," it says. Do the faithful really come so far?
The grave bears your name... A queer coincidence.
They've fallen half to ruin.
All who draw breath end up here below the earth... A grim thought.
Something about a graveyard by night...
That candle's seen its share of use.
Be glad you'll not be sleeping amid this filth.
You can see a hold beyond.
'Tis a sheer cliff. You'll find no purchase to climb it.
This scar in the earth... A river gone dry, perhaps?
Being near this spring puts your body and mind to ease...
You haven't the words to describe the horror of<cf>this bogwater... You feel ill.
The water's source.
The likeness is crude, but it's clearly the figure of a man.
A sword. It's rusted half to pieces.
Strange sight, to see such massive stones stacked one atop the other.
Quite the majestic structure.
Uncommon large, that tree.
The signs of past inhabitants remain.
Seems a difficult place to live.
Bones... Well weathered by now.
'Tis lit...
The treasure's there to see, but...
Died where they fell...
Human remains... Part of some ritual, perhaps?
A tattered flag... Foreign, to look at the device.
'Tis half-dead. Looks as if it were struck by lightning...
The way is blocked.
This place has a strange smell about it.
Soup's still warm.
A diary...
Well-preserved, but... 'Tis too late for this one.
The flowers are a sprightly pink.
It glows blue in the moonlight.
A page from someone's diary, it seems.
Striking scene. Moving to look upon, really.
You'll not get through here. Best use the west gate.
Someone's blocked it...
What's that flying above the capital? Best get<cf>closer...
Gran Soren is beset by a monster! You must hasten back.
You can make use of this.
'Tis broken... Unusable.
"Explosives! Do Not Touch!"
That giant rock looks fit to topple at a stiff<cf>breeze...
Had you an Empty Flask, you might fill it here.
'Tis more fragile than it looks. Best be gentle with it.
'Tis empty, now.
The notice board. 'Tis wise to keep an eye on it for work.
'Tis out, but would hold a fire fine if lit.
A bird's nest.
Seems you've taken the last of the mushrooms here.
You've taken all the ore this spot holds.
'Tis built to hold a human, but for who?
Someone's caught themselves a prisoner...
An impressive gate, and not like to open soon.
It cannot be opened from here.
Something around here must open the gate...
It has nary a scratch on it...it looks near alive.
"Mark well the fate of fools with<cf> designs on my pet."<cf>        —Ophis of the Westron Labrys
This sturdy chair would make a fine spot to mentor your main pawn, were they at hand...
Find more like this.
Collect more like this.
The lock opens.
As its said, best let sleeping dogs lie. Sleeping people, too.
You could attempt to strike up conversation...you just won't succeed.
Wakestones are miraculous items that can<cf>bring your character, pawn allies, or <cf>others back to life.

Oof.
Guh!
Uaaaugh...
Ha!
Sha-ha!
Aye?
By your leave.
Yes.
No...
My thanks.
I thank you for it, ser.
You cannot pass.
Cease at once!
Where are you...?
Move along!
You may pass.
Hold, ser.
Do not make this harder on yourself.
Now where might you be...
There!
Put the villain to chains!
I must return to my watch.
What?
You embarrass yourself, ser.
What's to become of this land...?
I'll do as I'm ordered, come what may.
Conditions are grim.
All we can do is our best, as ever.
I cannot believe it...
My thanks.
The sovereign of this land ill comprehends the urgency of the danger it faces.
This eve's empty pomp is ample proof. All gaiety, without a hint of real concern.
I'll allow, 'tis well understandable.
A people numbed by two generations of peace cannot be expected to know true resolve.
'Tis a lesson taught by fire and sacrifice. Pray, let His Grace learn before the fire takes all.
...But I ought not speak in such bold terms before His Grace.
I've naught else to say. Pray, excuse me.
Arisen? Ser? Beg pardon, ser.
I bear a message from milady Aelinore. She would speak with you ser...in private, if you please.
Some would...raise an eyebrow at such a request, given milady's vows to the duke... I trust...
Forgive me, Arisen! I must learn to hold my tongue around proper company. Pray, find me tonight in the castle gardens.
You should know you are the first companion milady has trusted since coming to this place.
I imagine she has all manner of subjects she would discuss with you.
So, indeed, yes... I ask you meet me at the castle garden. ...That is, if it please you, ser.
Praise the Maker you've come, Arisen! Oh, this is glorious, most glorious...
P-pardon me, ser. Forgive the ramblings of a handmaiden on a strange errand.
It's only... Milady's request to see you is a rare thing, you see. A first in all my years with her, in truth.
I trust you understand the delicacy of the situation? Milady is a married woman, I need not remind you...
And, well, yes... Even innocent conversation could be bent foul were it discovered by others.
Pray, walk softly, Arisen. And have a care to let none find you visiting milady's chambers!
Worry not after His Grace, Arisen.
He's not set foot within milady's chambers since the wedding night.
Yet his guard remains ever watchful. Take care to avoid discovery. 
Mm? What's this... A new recruit, is it?
My shift hardly started a moment ago...but as you're here, I'll not speak ill of good fortune.
Oi! There's naught here what concerns you.
Go on! Get moving!
Hail, brother.
Naught to report?
Who is that!?
An impostor!
I hear Benita has you picking flowers for her. Pray, just be cautious, cousin.
The monsters grow bolder by night. If you must leave the village, go prepared.
I do not fancy the thought of you going off on your own, but I trust in your judgment.
If you come by the inn, you can always rest until the hour you wish to set out. In any case, take care.
Open the gate! Quickly!
The Arisen, the pawn commander, here in Gran Soren.
A knight is no knight without a lord to serve, but what of pawns?
By what measure do they choose their master?
How does it feel to be chosen so by the pawns?
Do you fancy yourself a great knight, eh?
The battle with the dragon draws near, eh?
Throw your all into it, ser.
There's no end of pawns to follow any who fall. They ought, at least, to stall the beast a while.
I cannot believe it...

This is the city's west gate, opening on the Gransys Lea.
Further west across the flatlands you'll come to the hills, and crags beyond them.
Used to be, a man was safe from beasts and other evil till at least beyond those hills.
Now the dragon's come, monsters lurk all across the lea.
There's a road cuts the lea in twain, running north to south.
Walk it north, and there's a hill to the right bears a drawing of a man with a scarred chest.
Hillfigure Knoll, they call it. It's so overrun with beasts of late, most men don't go near it.
There is one man, though, sits right on the hill's crown.
A hermit of sorts, or a madman, else... Word is, he actually lives there.
Beyond this gate's the Gransys Lea. No doubt you're well familiar.
Might be you've seen Hillfigure Knoll as well, north along the road.
But have you been as far as the duke's manse, past the hill and around the gulf? 
It's a sister hall to the castle here in Gran Soren, built to house guests from the north.
Eastward past the manse, at the cape's point, there's a tower.
For all its size and grandeur, there's not a man knows when it was built, or why.
These days, it is nest to every manner of beast and demon. Keep your distance, traveler.
Take the road to the north and follow the crossroads west and you'll find a path heads into the mountains.
That leads on to the Greatwall. You'll not find a mightier hold in Gransys.
And good thing, for it bars all the evil of the tainted lands to the west from entering.
If the Greatwall should ever fall, beasts of all kind would spill into the lea in a black flood.
It chills my blood, even just to think of it.
It's a mercy the Greatwall still stands, at least in part...
Though what's the good, if stone walls are of no avail before the dragon?
If there's anyone could explain just what's happened, I would dearly welcome it...
For now, make haste to the castle. His Grace awaits your news, no doubt.
'Tis locked. You haven't the key to fit it...
'Tis caught on something. Perhaps it could open from the far side.
'Tis barred shut. Might be able to break the bolt.
'Tis shut tight.
'Tis no use at this hour. You'll have to come again later.
Best stop for now.
Seems they're closed.
Someone was here...
Lost them...
Gone...
Perhaps you've upset them.
There's naught to do here.
Best you moved on.
Not here...
The door is closed.
Shows no sign of opening.
There's aught there...
You don't see anything.
That smell...
Someone's near...
What's this...?
Fine view from here.
There's aught written here...
Must be a way to find something...
Smells delicious.
Perfect spot to place something.
You can almost reach...
There appears to be aught ahead.
That fall could kill.
'Tis dangerous to touch.
A strong blow might break it.
Perhaps if you came by night.
Perhaps if you came by day.
Perhaps if you came at dawn.
Perhaps if you came at dusk.
There's aught buried here...
You see no way up.
'Tis slick, this spot.
No use pressing any further.
No need to double back further.
No time for that now.
You cannot carry any more.
There may yet be aught lying about.
Seems there's naught you can take on at present.<cf>Best to try again later.
Perhaps with a bit of help...
Best you kept your weapon sheathed.
Is someone here...?
'Tis a place for tall folk.
'Tis a place for small folk.
Had you a woman in your band...
Had you a man in your band...
Had you a strong companion...
Had you a swift companion...
Had you a magick user...
Had you an apt climber...
Had you a skilled jumper...
This weapon will not help you.
That armor won't protect you.
You're ill equipped for this.
Seems it can't be used now.
You'll get no further use from it.
'Tis useless, now.
Hmm, not with your current equipment...
Not with your current party...
You hear aught from further in.
Enemies... They're close.
Best you got some rest.
You can carry no more!
You're too exhausted!
"Danger! Keep Out!"
"No Trespassing"
A sign.
Had you an Empty Flask, you might fill it here.
You'll get no further without a lantern.
'Tis dangerous to fumble about in the dark. Best find a light.
Best not just leave them.
If aught were left here, it would rot.
Best take care you don't get lost.
Best check the map.
You're due for a rest.
This place is dangerous by night.
This place is dangerous by day.
Breathtaking...
You'll get no further!
Seems you'll need to come back.
Nothing left here.
It looks fit to crumble.
Seems it could be moved...
It will not budge.
It will not open.
Seems you need a key.
Seems you need a Pickaxe here.
You yet lack the experience.
You yet lack the skill.
Not with your current vocation...
You'll not pass through this gate.
You've no time!
Seems you were too late.
You may make it, yet.
You're doing well for time.
Seems you've come at the wrong time.
There may be another path.
'Tis a powerful weapon... Too bad it doesn't work.

Perhaps this errand for Reynard will buy<cf>us favorable treatment in times to come.
We'll need to fetch what he asks if we<cf>hope to earn his trust.
'Tis what Reynard sought! Now to<cf>deliver it...
Do you recall what Reynard asked of us?
It feels as though we've won a bit<cf>of his trust.
Ah, at last! Reynard will be most pleased.
His father's diary, eh...? That strikes<cf>me as familiar somehow...
Master, did we not once possess such<cf>a journal?
We left the journal in safekeeping,<cf>did we not?
Hmm... Where would one best begin a<cf>search for a lost diary?
It would be half a miracle to locate<cf>such... Still, it costs nothing to search.
I'm pleased to know we've earned his trust<cf>in full.
A daybook, then. That, at least, narrows our search.
Journal pages could be scattered anywhere from city<cf>streets to caverns.
We'd best keep Symone in sight.
Quickly, Master! After her.
Quick as a hare, this one. And as flighty.
We must stay close to her.
I'll have her found in a trice.
Over here, perhaps?
It feels as though she's this way...
Where could she have hidden?
Where do you suppose she's gone?
The markets are crowded.<cf>Best keep a close watch.
Now the markets...
Careful! We cannot let her out of<cf>our sight.
Let's return to Symone.
Let's speed this back to Symone.
Seems we were mistaken...
It seems we did not meet her<cf>expectations.
This is certainly strange.
Let's take up her challenge!
A might old for children's games, aren't<cf>you, Master?
She's not far. I'm certain of it...
Outrun by a child...
'Twas very kind, what you did.
Where is Symone? We must find her.
She seems disappointed...
Her father's treasure, that one.
The better she enjoys herself, the more<cf>we're like to earn.
We'll not lose in a footrace!
Perhaps 'tis best you let her win,<cf>Arisen. Cede your pride.
The fountain is but a short walk from here.<cf>Let's join her.
Capricious girl...
Now the markets, is it?<cf>Well, we'd best accompany her.
It must be near...
I believe 'tis that way!
Seems this is not the place.
We've done it!
Your stupidity beggars belief. Leave!
You aren't too keen on living, are you.
Piss off.
Looking for a fight, are you?
Cause trouble here and you'll soon regret it.
Aahn?
Don't waste your breath talking to me, and I won't have to waste my time killing you.
If you've no business here, move on.
You ought to join us! We wouldn't be too hard on you...
Come to visit, friend?
What? Who the hell are you?
Piss off!
Am I supposed to care about your fancy title?
You're not wanted here, get it?
You're about to find out what we do to trespassers firsthand.
I was just thinking about dealing someone bodily harm. Shall I start with you?
Bugger off!
You're as brazen a fool as any I've seen.
Don't you ever leave?
No one's killed you yet?
How goes it?
Hey!
Those pig-swiving, pox-stricken strumpets!
What're we to do about it?
Oho?
It's well past time to collect on these debts.
Now, what is the best way to make them bleed?
There's an idea!
Eh?
Ahh...exactly.
Then what?
Human! A human comes!
Kill it! Kill it!
Pick its bones!
Death to the human!
Here! Here, now!
Open up!
Come! Help!
Help! Help!
Bah! Fool humans!
Think you've won?
Dead! You lot are finished!
All the world, finished! All will die!
The dragon comes!
Humans want destruction, too!
Humans want the dragon! Welcome it!
Kill each other! Kill all you like! The end is nigh!
Graaaugh!
Just look upon it... Gran Soren is lost.
Turn back, Arisen. The way ahead is too dangerous.
I fear for the duke's safety, ser. Pray, go and see to him.
Arousing Suspicion

Are you not with the convoy, then!?
We were told to await a cart with important freight. We'll pass no strangers till then.
Away with you!
What d'you think you're doing!?
Bugger off!
Think y'er a big shot, do ya?
Shove off, friend.
Think you can just stroll around like the duke himself?
Keep pestering me and I'll answer you with my fist!
What are you waiting for!?
You're an odd one...
You really haven't anything better to do?
Still here, are you?
How do you fare?
Hoy!
Unforgivable!
This is a cruel jape indeed...
...For true?
We should've finished them when we had the chance...
This time, we won' be so forgiving.
Aye, aye...
What?
Ohh...
What next?
You are blind to the truth, Arisen!
Perdition is nigh! The hour of redemption is upon us!
All will burn, and through fire return to nothingness!
In the name of Salvation, the world must know chaos. The world must know destruction!
State your business!
Who goes there!?
Where d'you think you're going?
Halt!
You'll go no farther!
M-my deepest apologies...
What brings you here, ser?
I cannot allow even the Arisen to pass unbidden.
I would thank you to refrain from such actions in the future, ser...
No further, ser. We're not to admit any guests past this point.
We ought seek out Father Geffrey at<cf>the cathedral.
Father Geffrey awaits at the cathedral.
The brother must've entered the<cf>ruins beyond the falls.
If we find the lost monk, he'll<cf>surely have the key.
The lost monk must possess the key.
I believe there is a lever on the<cf>lowest floor.
A slate! This way!
The slates are too heavy to carry<cf>all at once.
The slates are so heavy, 'tis<cf>difficult to carry much else.
Let us go back and report.
The Watergod's Altar hides behind<cf>the falls.
This road should take us to the falls.
This road should lead to the ruins.
This way to the Watergod's Altar.
The ruins are just ahead, Arisen.
Cross this river and we've arrived.
A massive creature lurks just beyond!
There's aught on the floor!
I believe there are five in total.
This key must fit a door somewhere...
We may have use of that key...
We've collected a fair amount...<cf>Let's go speak with the brother.
That makes five.<cf>Let's return to the monk.
Seems there are more yet.
I shall see you to the Watergod's<cf>Altar. Follow me.
Just how many tablets do you<cf>suppose there are?
There are five tablets in total,<cf>Arisen. We're nearly there.
Father Geffrey will be in the<cf>cathedral, Arisen.
Perhaps we would benefit from a guide more familiar with these ruins.
Behind a waterfall, you say? Then you seek<cf>the Watergod's Altar. Follow me, Arisen.
I see no sign of the monk's key...
Perhaps the key lies in the cyclops'<cf>belly, along with its owner... <cf>
So, defeat the cyclops, and the key<cf>to the ruins is ours.
A terrible shame... Best we returned with word of this.
Not that way.
Let us check the map.
This way!
We'll leave when you are ready, Master.
Here, Arisen.
Let us return to the capital.
Monsters!
We must help!
'Tis a shame...
We failed them...
How did this happen...?
We've made it.
We're here!
A glorious view.
I've ne'er seen its like.
Pleasant breeze, isn't it?
...I've no words.
I'll not soon forget this day...
Amazing.
'Tis enough to stir all six senses to life.
Truly, 'tis a place of legends...
'Tis the sad result of a lack in<cf>preparedness, I fear.
We failed to keep them safe... Words cannot express<cf>my regret...
Have you heard the talk? They say the dragon's coming to burn this place to ash.
That said, be it ash or dust, there'll still be cleaning to be done.
Know of a way a girl can earn some quick coin?
I'd run, if I had any place to go.
Duchess Aelinore came from up north, over the mountains.
You suppose it would be safe there?
Too late to run now. Should have been moving my legs all this while, 'stead of just my mouth.
Oh... I see we are kindred spirits, ser.
Will you be at the gathering, then? Word is, there's to be a high officiant presiding.
Not that us lot would be permitted to speak with one in such an office directly, mind.
So, this is the Arisen. I see no difference in your mien than any other knight...
What is it you possess that sets you so apart? A hidden strength? Good fortune?
Hm? A tablet you found in the woods, you say? Hmm, it has the look of Wyrmspeak.
I fear for all our research, we've still more questions than answers. I cannot read it, ser.
Though now I think upon it, I have heard tell of a man well-versed in such ancient texts. A man near the capital...
I think it was by Hillfigure Knoll they said he dwells.
It grieves me to have only such muddle hearsay to offer, but perhaps it is worth the journey?
There's tell a man able to decipher Wyrmspeak lives by Hillfigure Knoll.
It grieves me to have only such muddle hearsay to offer, but perhaps it is worth the journey?
I've no use for you.
Keep your distance, filth.
You've no place here.
Aanh?
Be off with you.
Why are you here?
Don't get cocky, you.
Scared, are you?
To living easy, aye?
Hoy there. You look eager.
'Tis locked. You haven't the key to fit it...
'Tis caught on something. Perhaps it could open from the far side.
'Tis barred shut. Might be able to break the bolt.
'Tis shut tight.
'Tis no use at this hour. You'll have to come again later.
Best stop for now.
Seems they're closed.
Someone was here...
Lost them...
Gone...
Perhaps you've upset them.
There's naught to do here.
Best you moved on.
Not here...
The door is closed.
Shows no sign of opening.
There's aught there...
You don't see anything.
That smell...
Someone's near...
What's this...?
Fine view from here.
There's aught written here...
Must be a way to find something...
Smells delicious.
Perfect spot to place something.
You can almost reach...
There appears to be aught ahead.
That fall could kill.
'Tis dangerous to touch.
A strong blow might break it.
Perhaps if you came by night.
Perhaps if you came by day.
Perhaps if you came at dawn.
Perhaps if you came at dusk.
There's aught buried here...
You see no way up.
'Tis slick, this spot.
No use pressing any further.
No need to double back further.
No time for that now.
You cannot carry any more.
There may yet be aught lying about.
Seems there's naught you can take on at present.<cf>Best to try again later.
Perhaps with a bit of help...
Best you kept your weapon sheathed.
Is someone here...?
'Tis a place for tall folk.
'Tis a place for small folk.
Had you a woman in your band...
Had you a man in your band...
Had you a strong companion...
Had you a swift companion...
Had you a magick user...
Had you an apt climber...
Had you a skilled jumper...
This weapon will not help you.
That armor won't protect you.
You're ill equipped for this.
Seems it can't be used now.
You'll get no further use from it.
'Tis useless, now.
Hmm, not with your current equipment...
Not with your current party...
You hear aught from further in.
Enemies... They're close.
Best you got some rest.
You can carry no more!
You're too exhausted!
"Danger! Keep Out!"
"No Trespassing"
A sign.
Had you an Empty Flask, you might fill it here.
You'll get no further without a lantern.
'Tis dangerous to fumble about in the dark. Best find a light.
Best not just leave them.
If aught were left here, it would rot.
Best take care you don't get lost.
Best check the map.
You're due for a rest.
This place is dangerous by night.
This place is dangerous by day.
Breathtaking...
You'll get no further!
Seems you'll need to come back.
Nothing left here.
It looks fit to crumble.
Seems it could be moved...
It will not budge.
It will not open.
Seems you need a key.
Seems you need a Pickaxe here.
You yet lack the experience.
You yet lack the skill.
Not with your current vocation...
You'll not pass through this gate.
You've no time!
Seems you were too late.
You may make it, yet.
You're doing well for time.
Seems you've come at the wrong time.
There may be another path.
'Tis a powerful weapon... Too bad it doesn't work.
Wakestones are miraculous items that can<cf>bring your character, pawn allies, or <cf>others back to life.
Treasure each Wakestone, for the fragments<cf>required to form them are quite rare, and<cf>each stone can only be used once.
Gather enough Wakestone Shards and<cf>they will automatically assemble to<cf>form a complete stone.
Your main pawn will earn rift crystals<cf>while online in other worlds. Encourage<cf>other players to enlist your minion!
A Ferrystone will spirit you back to Gran<cf>Soren in an instant, no matter where you<cf>are located.
It is by far the fastest and safest method<cf>of travel, but each stone disappears after<cf>a single use.
You can equip yourself with a primary and<cf>a secondary weapon.
Primary weapons such as swords and daggers<cf>are combat essentials. Secondary weapons<cf>like bows and shields offer support.
In addition to weapons and armor, you can<cf>also equip accoutrements with certain special<cf>abilities to give you an edge in battle.
Only one piece of jewelry and a single<cf>cloak can be equipped as accoutrements<cf>at any one time.
A heavy load will cause your Stamina to<cf>deplete more quickly. Sell or discard<cf>any and all items you no longer need.
Your lantern consumes oil. If it dims,<cf>use a Flask of Oil to refill it.
Some items can be combined with others to<cf>produce surprising results. Experiment and<cf>see what you come up with. 
Place waypoint markers on your map to<cf>keep track of your progress.
If you've forgotten where you are in the story,<cf>select "Chronicle" from the Pause Menu to<cf>review a history of your journey thus far.
Select "Options" from the Pause Menu to<cf>customize your mini-map and status display.
The higher the fall, the more damage you<cf>will suffer.
Note that you move somewhat slower while<cf>your weapon is drawn.
Exhausting all Stamina will make you unable<cf>to act for a time. Take care to conserve<cf>energy!
You can attack while clinging to foes.
Petrifaction cannot be cured by normal<cf>magick, and is fatal if left untreated.
Use Secret Softener or the like to<cf>cure any petrified allies.
Your rank within a vocation rises as you<cf>defeat foes and complete quests. At higher<cf>ranks, a broader variety of skills are available.
Defeating foes and completing quests earns<cf>you more discipline, boosting your prowess<cf>in a vocation.
Pawns will collect and use items of their<cf>own volition.
You cannot carry or purchase items that<cf>would cause you to exceed your maximum<cf>encumbrance.
Press <TUTO><SIZE 25><ICON TOUCH></SIZE> while climbing down a ladder<cf>to descend quickly. 
If a pawn remains unconscious for too long,<cf>they will be forfeit.
Your support pawn has become forfeit, and<cf>returned to the realm whence they came.
Your main pawn has become forfeit,<cf>disappearing and returning to the rift.
You cannot join covenants with other pawns<cf>while your main pawn is forfeit.
Touch any riftstone to return your lost<cf>main pawn to your side.
If a support pawn is forfeit, any items<cf>they were carrying are sent to item storage.
You can send off departing pawns with a<cf>single item as a gift for their creator.
You can pass items to and from your pawns<cf>on the sub menu.
Welcome, good Arisen.
Hmm, three days, this one. A week, perhaps?
A favored game of mine, guessing the lifespan of<cf>those who enter these halls.
Nothing personal, mind. And rest easy, friend: three<cf>score guesses in, I've yet to hit the mark once.
Someone's looking for me? Then this pit is<cf>home to stranger folk than even I'd imagined.
An honest mistake, most like. I've been down<cf>here half an age, and not once have I known<cf>anyone to come calling.
Helping others is the Maker's work, friend.<cf>Why not leave it to Him and busy yourself<cf>with staying alive?
I'm not the sort to take directions, besides.<cf>I go where I please. We seem alike in that.
Well, this is a surprise. Can you just come and<cf>go as you please, then?
I'd thought everyone come to this place was<cf>lost to the world outside. Myself included.
Ah, well. It's the exception what proves the<cf>rule, or so they say.
My trade? Isn't it obvious? ...Heh, no, I don't<cf>suppose it is.
I'm a wandering scholar of sorts, and an Arisen<cf>besides, though I may not look like either.
In truth, I've left the wyrm hunting racket. A<cf>dangerous pursuit, and the rewards are meager.
But speaking of remuneration, I'll fain help you<cf>in your travels if you furnish the coin.
The poor fools drawn into this place all come<cf>singing the same tune, by and large.
Heroes, every one, the deluded fools. Sold on<cf>dreams of fixing this blighted world by kings<cf>and lords with their own agendas.
It's that, or the knightly types with their lofty<cf>lust for strength, eager to whet their blades<cf>with any foul creature they find.
I'll thank you to leave me out of either pile.
And which are you, then? What is it you hope<cf>to find here? If it's fame or fortune, pray, look<cf>elsewhere, friend. You have that luxury.
You must be well bored of your hunt to be<cf>wasting time in here. Or well confident.
This little island and what lies beneath it are<cf>a pretty mess, don't you think?
I've done my share of exploring, and I'll aver<cf>this place appears in no map or text I've ever<cf>seen.
Even the halls that link one chamber to the next<cf>are mad. The work of some diabolic magick, like<cf>as not.
A place so steeped in rancor just begs for<cf>conquest, doesn't it? Gets my juices flowing.
One look around and it's clear we're rats in a<cf>trap here, friend.
But then, I'm a strange sort. This sort of welcome<cf>puts me more at ease than any hospitality.
I was an apothecary, afore becoming an Arisen.
Made my coin mixing potions. Fusing reagents<cf>into new compounds. New elements. Alchemy,<cf>in a word.
This place is a trove of herbs and ores found<cf>nowhere else. Nowhere natural.
I've seen gold and jewels enough to rot my eyes,<cf>but the treasures this place hides ought keep me<cf>entertained for years to come.
The wandering life is sweet enough, once you've<cf>grown accustomed to it.
I'll speak no ill of others' dreams and duties, but<cf>I found my own oppressive, and a terrible bore.
It's been many a year since I parted ways with<cf>my heart, and I can't say as I miss it much.
Were I still mortal, being stranded on this island<cf>hell might have caused me some bother.
Slaying beasts holds no allure for me.
And immortal or not, I've no time to waste on<cf>that which bores me. I'm content to spend<cf>eternity fleeing.
That is, until I've need of a fang or a wing or<cf>some such for a compound I aim to make.
In that case, Maker pity the beasties. I'm strong<cf>as the wyrm, when I can be bothered.
Rather cozy, this place. Save the perpetual<cf>darkness.
That Olra girl is a strange one.
Why's she have you looking about for this friend<cf>of hers?
Most folk down here are would-be heroes eager<cf>for glory, or hollow husks who've ceded all hope.<cf>Either way, they're a simple lot.
The inscrutable ones like her are rare.
Forgive my nattering on. It's not that I'm bored,<cf>exactly. Just newcomers as game as you are a<cf>rare treat.
You can feel it, can't you? This place is<cf>wrought from the will of some creator.
I don't mean the Maker, mind. I keep no truck with<cf>the Faith. No, this place is like a memory given<cf>form...
We're guests in someone's imaginary world, you<cf>and I... Else rabbits in their snare.
Seems our host has a taste for hunting Arisen.
Best we were thankful we haven't all simply been<cf>cast into the abyss directly. Either he's the sporting<cf>sort, or he lacks a surety to his purpose.
Perhaps he's simply waiting for someone like you--<cf>a feisty challenger to come and unseat him.
Sent our host to his grave, have you? Heh, remind<cf>me never to cross you.
Still, seems these walls aren't about to come<cf>crumbling down for want of his presence.
Mayhap they've taken root in one material plane.<cf>'Tis idle conjecture, and of precious little import<cf>either way.
This place is without its master...and yet the<cf>beasts persist within it unabated. Strange, that.
Ah, well. I'll do as I will. They can do the same.
You feel that? Something grievous dark is stirring<cf>within the bowels of the earth below us.
It bears the stink of the dragon... Worse, perhaps.
Just what have you gone and woken up?
Ever stopped to ponder just what manner of<cf>place this is, friend?
I say it certain that no such island existed off<cf>the land I came from. No record names it.
Though you need look no further than the links<cf>between this cavern's halls to know aught is<cf>amiss.
Nature bears no fruit so strange. We're guests<cf>in a world fabricated by someone or something.
To look at you, I'd wager you've seen it. Aye?
Had your tussle with the dragon, then espied<cf>the grand scheme of the world. How it's built.
Then you'll know the wisdom of leaving it all be.
Have you ever had cause to miss your heart?
Steer clear of cliffs and beasts beyond your<cf>means and you can live forever.
If wandering the countryside has lost its charm,<cf>take up residence here. I'd welcome a drinking<cf>partner.
You been hearing voices since coming to this<cf>place, friend?
Echoes of the dead, those.
Even the least of them what's fallen here was<cf>an Arisen in a former life.
Seems their wills were too strong to end with the<cf>body, and so they remain. Obstinate things.
It's a blessing they do more than just grumble<cf>and grouse. I'd go mad.
Where do the beasts here come from? You ever<cf>think on that, friend?
We're cut off from the world. Worlds. Whichever.<cf>It's naught but Arisen and pawns what come here.<cf>And that's when it hit me.
What if they're what's left of those fallen heroes?<cf>What happens to a soul bottled up in a place like<cf>this?
Some find peace enough etching their regrets in<cf>stone, but others... What if they just rot? Rot, and<cf>become darker things...
Just an idle theory, mind.
Mayhap we'll find out when I die and join their<cf>ranks.
If I run into you then, I'll expect a proper greeting.
You're far from the first new face I've come across<cf>here.
Most come bearing invitations, but I've turned the<cf>lot of them down.
No common cause. They fight to be quit of this<cf>place, while I find it rather cozy.
So I send them off with a bit of advice--worry<cf>less, and enjoy more.
The fact I haven't seen any of them again means<cf>either they got their wish, or got dead.
Either way, I'll not hold my breath for a reunion.
Clawing your way through the dark for days on<cf>end takes its toll.
Often as not, it's not the beasts that get you,<cf>but the crushing despair.
A man can be plagued by the voice of doubt<cf>anywhere, but down here the whispers are real.
You've heard them, sure, by now? Voices waxing<cf>fatalistic about the uselessness of it all...
I can scarce imagine the sort of grudge this<cf>isle's creator must bear against the Arisen.
Still less what I've done to earn my place here.<cf>I'm a simple wanderer. Keep to myself.
I've no illusions of entitlement as an Arisen. I've<cf>earned no one's respect and adulation, nor do I<cf>crave it.
But neither, surely, have I earned such retribution.
I wasn't the first to come here. It was a colorful<cf>cast already when I arrived.
An old man, half-dead by the time I met him. The<cf>other half didn't take long.
Another was a woman. Ahh, she'd have been a<cf>real gem, save that over-serious nature.
By the end, she treated me with the same<cf>contempt she would a beast.
Had she been freer with her charms around<cf>beasts, she might not have wound up serving<cf>as their supper. Still, a shame...
It's simple luck that I've survived this long. I've<cf>no illusions on that count.
Even in this forsaken hell, there's riftstones<cf>about to call for pawns.
Many are in disrepair, but the right price will<cf>buy them back to usefulness, it seems.
Convenient thing, that.
Mayhap this place is kindred to the other world<cf>the pawn legion speak of.
Either way, it's a thoughtful provision, aye? I'll<cf>have to thank our host, should I ever meet him.
Slay one pack of beasts, and another comes to<cf>pick their bones.
Like as not, a nastier breed than the ones before.<cf>There are times fighting brings more danger than<cf>safety.
I've lost good pawns to those scavengers. Damn<cf>near lost my head to a few.
If you aim to kill the creatures here, be mindful of<cf>the where and when. Don't get in over your head.
This place is full to the gills with scraps and<cf>materials unseen in the world I knew outside.
An alchemist's paradise, this. The smithy's work<cf>I do is the product of endless hours' trial and error.
But it's time I don't begrudge. My little obsession's<cf>half the reason for my wanderings.
Could be, the other half is running into strange<cf>ones like you, friend.
When I was made Arisen, I asked myself just what<cf>sort of role it was the world had handed me.
From the very start, I'd no interest in chasing after<cf>my heart. Useless thing.
If eternity was mine to pass as I saw fit, I'd pass<cf>it doing what I liked. That was my answer.
And what of you? You the type to buy into talk of<cf>duty and fate and all that?
I've stopped thinking about it, truth be told. Like<cf>as not, there is no real answer.
I'm hardly fit to say this, given how I've set up<cf>shop here...
But have you really nowhere else to be? No affairs<cf>more pressing?
I doubt you'll find any real answers carving up the<cf>creatures of these dark halls.
Hoy there!
Can anyone hear me? Pray, come and help!
Is no one there?
There's trouble down the well!
These days, you've got to watch out for yourself.
No one knows what tomorrow may bring.
No one knows what tomorrow may bring.
No one knows what tomorrow may bring.
Hear ye! Hear ye!
The prophets 'ave spoken, friends!<cf>The dragon's return is nigh!
Join the hon'rable duke's ranks<cf>and help us be rid o' the fell beast!
The day's come to lay down rod and reel<cf>and take up the sword!
It's -- it's the dragon!
'Tis locked. You haven't the key to fit it...
'Tis caught on something. Perhaps it could open from the far side.
'Tis barred shut. Might be able to break the bolt.
'Tis shut tight.
'Tis no use at this hour. You'll have to come again later.

Perhaps with a bit of help...
Best you kept your weapon sheathed.
Is someone here...?
'Tis a place for tall folk.
'Tis a place for small folk.
Had you a woman in your band...
Had you a man in your band...
Had you a strong companion...
Had you a swift companion...
Had you a magick user...
Had you an apt climber...
Had you a skilled jumper...
This weapon will not help you.
That armor won't protect you.

You'll not pass through this gate.
You've no time!
Seems you were too late.
You may make it, yet.
You're doing well for time.
Seems you've come at the wrong time.
There may be another path.
'Tis a powerful weapon... Too bad it doesn't work.
Uh!
Uaugh!
Waaaaugh...
Hah!
Yaah!
Ah, greetings.
Fare well.
Yes.
Oh, no...
Thank you.
'Tis very kind of you.
I finally secure passage from the mainland, only to learn we're under siege from a dragon.
If not for ill luck, I would truly possess none at all.
I made for the mainland to avail myself of the Great Library. It's the finest collection of letters in all the lands. 
Though I oft lose myself in books, my journey was no holiday.
My master tasked me with the investigation of rare and valuable crops, that we might gain sway over other merchants.
I return here to find my master fled, and all people cowering in the shadow of the wyrm.
I'm unsure what path to follow from here, truth be told...
So the dragon flies about, heading where it will...
Laying waste to any land unfortunate enough to fall under its shadow...
Books burn easily. When I think of all the knowledge lost to the dragon's flame...
But what can I do -- what can any man do against the wyrm?
The Church has studied the dragon for ages, but each time he strikes, pieces of that knowledge are lost.
What if all of man's learning was retained somehow? What if knowledge was never forgot?
Think of all we could accomplish...
The circle spins again... What can be done about it all?
Eh? You defeated the dragon? Yes, yes, huzzah for you, good ser...
My master remains missing...
With him absent, I find myself yet adrift, without purpose...
'Tis very kind of you.
If you've no business with the duchess, I ask you go no further, ser.
Dare we press on deeper still?
We can still return to the surface. Let<cf>us not allow ambition to be our end...
The dark grows deeper...thicker.

We'll need to open this gate to use<cf>the lift.
We cannot pass through.
Seems there's a room beyond the<cf>rubble...
This place crawls with the undead...
Be careful -- the walking dead are<cf>all around us.
I'd wager we could scale that wall.
Would that we had some manner of<cf>foothold...
Take care with the closed coffins!
There may be aught inside the coffins.
I believe some of the coffins are<cf>booby trapped.
Check closely before opening the<cf>coffins.
If we lit lamps, we could more<cf>easily see the traps.
If you see gas leaking, 'tis likely<cf>a gas trap.
We could light this lamp, master.
The lamplight will make spotting<cf>traps easier.
This door is held locked by some<cf>mechanism...
We'll find the mechanism faster<cf>with more light.
We need light, Arisen.
Undead sleep beneath the earth!
Watch the ground below you!
Lighting these lamps could be of use...
'Tis locked...
It appears locked, and by no common<cf>key...
This must do something...
Now we can get down below.
It leads down below.
...There certainly are a great<cf>number of walls.
'Tis a labyrinth in here...
A monster stalks the passage ahead.
We can like slay it safely from here.
If we kill it now, we needn't spill<cf>a drop of our own blood.
There seems no way to open it...
Someone awaits within... I can feel<cf>it. Be careful, Arisen.
Another trick door, it seems.
Is the switch to open it nearby?
The switch ought to be to the right<cf>of the door.
Treasure, master...
The gate is shut tight, and too<cf>sturdy to break, besides.
There must be a way around<cf>somewhere...
I believe this leads outside.
From the look of it, this leads outside.
We may need a quick escape...best<cf>remember this spot.
Where could this hole lead?
We can climb down here.
Shall we? We can always turn back<cf>if it proves dangerous.
'Tis locked...
I see no way to open it.
We'd best move on for now.
We'll not pass through without the<cf>key...
Where could this path lead?
It seems the path leads above.
It may lead to the blocked off area<cf>we passed.
This should get us to that treasure<cf>chest.
Uneven terrain in here...
We can likely use those to hide,<cf>should the need arise.
If monsters appear, let's take<cf>advantage of the uneven terrain.
Best you leave that coffin<cf>untouched, Master.
This lever ought set the lift to motion.
Do you hear that...?
Few come to offer prayers for those<cf>who rest here in the catacombs.
The crypt was fashioned ages ago,<cf>before the Faith came to Gransys.
Long ago, when the people worshipped<cf>the old gods, the gods of nature.
I suspect it's why they returned their<cf>dead to the soil. To the Earthgod.
That their souls might be cleansed and<cf>born anew in the coming generations.
The structure is built from a natural<cf>cavern. 'Tis half a labyrinth inside.
And crumbled here and there with age,<cf>what's more. 'Tis a lost place.
Yet still these vermin come. No honest<cf>business brings a man to such a place.
To judge from the beasts that dwell<cf>here, the place holds a dark power.
If ever it was the seat of a god,<cf>that time has surely past.
Ah...
Aah!
Nnngh...
Ho.
Shah!
Begging your pardon.
I'll be off, then.
I s'pose that's so, aye.
I wouldn't think so...
You have my thanks.
Maker bless you for your kindness.
I've nothing for you, ser. Nothing at all...
Please, ser. Just...leave me in peace.
What's the point to it all, anyway?
Least there's food, eh? On the good days...
Seems that Fortune smiles on those that aren't me...
Can I live long enough for my luck to turn?
When it rains, it pours...
It's over... Surely, 'tis the end of all of us...
You have my thanks.
Whence came those corpses?
What is a corpse? What meaning does it hold?
Sweet Quina is so diligent in her studies. I pray the Maker guide her on to ever greater things.
...Arisen. Bearer of the dragon's mark. Undying<cf>corpse, enjoined to make your will manifest.
If my voice reaches you, heed me well.
The Arisen, the Seneschal, the whole cursed world...<cf>All is but an illusion.
A meaningless refrain. A hollow echo... What sense<cf>is there in giving one's life for these falsehoods?
I damn them all.
And I will not cease in my destruction until the last<cf>senseless cycle is broken, the last bond rent to<cf>dust.
Still-hearted kinsman, you have my thanks.
To destroy is simpler than to create...and harder<cf>still is to see aught to fruition. To end it rightly.
The infinite chain is yours, Arisen, to grant<cf>measure. To give what shape you will.
And I, at last, can step beyond its span...
My Grette... Dearest Olra...
No paths lead hence.
Repent the folly of ascribing meaning to the void.
Naught shall remain.
Fall, molder, and be gone.
Be cast into nothingness.
This strength... Is this the temper of your will?
You have seen the world for the meaningless<cf>cycle that it is, yet even still...
I have raged and wrought destruction.
With my every breath I cursed the eternal<cf>chain and all who would perpetuate it.
But more than this, I have waited...
Waited for one with a will to outmatch my<cf>own, that they may break the bonds that<cf>hold me here.
In hate's demise... freedom...
Unto all things, unity in destruction.
I have seen the scattering of countless<cf>myriad souls...
They gather and flow to become as the river<cf>of time, expanding to fill the firmament.
What a base and trifling creature is man...
Yet at once is he the master of this<cf>empyreal flow, grand as all the heavens.
I bid you, hone your spirit. Refine it.
I shall await you in the crucible of souls.
Naught shall remain.
I have raged and wrought destruction.
What a base and trifling creature is man...
I bid you, hone your spirit. Refine it.
Purchase equipment and useful items from<cf>shops or wandering merchants you encounter<cf>on your travels.
You can restore Health and Stamina and<cf>advance the passage of time at any inn<cf>or resting spot.
A wealth of useful items can be found<cf>by vanquishing monsters or exploring the<cf>environment. Keep your eyes peeled.
You can see a full description of any<cf>item you possess by checking your<cf>inventory with <TUTO><SIZE 28><ICON PAD_SL></SIZE>.
Your vocation determines your basic<cf>attributes, wieldable equipment,<cf>and skills.
Once you have reached a certain level,<cf>you may go to the inn to undertake<cf>advanced vocations.
Rifts allow you to search for and hire<cf>pawns that meet your particular needs.
Speak with a pawn to enlist him or her<cf>as a party member.
Defeating foes and completing quests<cf>earns you experience, and each level<cf>gained raises all of your attributes.
Materials collected during your travels<cf>can be used at shops or other locations<cf>to enhance your equipment. 
A Ferrystone will spirit you back to Gran<cf>Soren in an instant, no matter where you<cf>are located.
It is by far the fastest and safest method<cf>of travel, but each stone disappears after<cf>a single use.
Portcrystals work in tandem with<cf>Ferrystones.
A circle of Portcrystals is set in the<cf>soil at Gran Soren, but another movable<cf>crystal can be found somewhere in Gransys.
Embed this Portcrystal in the ground any<cf>place save a dungeon, and you can use<cf>a Ferrystone to return there in an instant.
Wakestones are miraculous items that can<cf>bring your character, pawn allies, or <cf>others back to life.
Treasure each Wakestone, for the fragments<cf>required to form them are quite rare, and<cf>each stone can only be used once.
Gather enough Wakestone Shards and<cf>they will automatically assemble to<cf>form a complete stone.
This is your main pawn, the companion you<cf>created as Arisen. It will forever act as<cf>your faithful servant.
Under your guidance, your main pawn will<cf>learn and evolve its skills and other<cf>behaviors in the course of your adventures.
Pawns may also offer advice, as they see<cf>fit, in particular areas.
If you're connected online, you can summon<cf>pawns who serve other masters -- pawns<cf>created by other players.
These summoned pawns do not gain levels.<cf>Experience they earn transmutes into rift<cf>crystals when they return to their master.
Any item a summoned pawn equips will<cf>become a gift to their master when you<cf>relieve the pawn, and cannot be retrieved.
The main pawn you created can travel<cf>to other worlds online to assist other<cf>players in their travels.
These adventures can result in new<cf>knowledge, items, and equipment they<cf>bring back when they return.
Always make conversation with folks you<cf>see in town or out on the roads. Some may<cf>offer important information or quests.
Available quests change as you progress<cf>through the game. Additionally, you can<cf>always consult the "Quests" section of the<cf>Pause Menu for your current objectives.
If you have several quests ongoing at the<cf>same time, you can set one as "Priority"<cf>in the "Quests" section of the Pause Menu.
Doing so will make all people, places,<cf>and things relevant to the priority quest<cf>appear prominently on your mini-map.
Pawns in your party will also offer advice<cf>for the priority quest more often than for<cf>other quests in your log.
Notice boards across Gransys advertise<cf>quests -- errands and favors you can<cf>choose to undertake.
This game has an auto-save function,<cf>periodically saving your progress<cf>throughout your adventure.
You can also save manually any time<cf>you like by pressing <TUTO><SIZE 28><ICON PAD_SL></SIZE> on the<cf>Pause Menu.
You can also save manually any time<cf>you like by pressing <TUTO><SIZE 28><ICON PAD_SL></SIZE> on the<cf>Pause Menu.
When you're connected online, your main<cf>pawn's attributes will be uploaded every<cf>time you rest at an inn.
Your main pawn will gain boons earned in<cf>other worlds at the inn, as well. Visit<cf>often to keep current on any developments.
The Ur-Dragon is an incredibly powerful foe.<cf>Defeating it requires multiple encounters,<cf>chipping more of its health away each time.
When you're connected online, other<cf>players' progress will contribute to<cf>defeating the Ur-Dragon in your instance.
The reward you earn all depends on how<cf>much damage you dish out. If you're really<cf>lucky, you may even deliver the final blow!
A powerful, evil enemy lurks nearby.<cf>Beware engaging any pawns in battle, for<cf>they may be under its influence.
You can equip yourself with a primary and<cf>a secondary weapon.
Primary weapons such as swords and daggers<cf>are combat essentials. Secondary weapons<cf>like bows and shields offer support.
Protective gear can be equipped on your<cf>head, chest, arms, and legs.
Raiment can be worn in addition to armor<cf>everywhere except the arms and head.
In addition to weapons and armor, you can<cf>also equip accoutrements with certain special<cf>abilities to give you an edge in battle.
Only one piece of jewelry and a single<cf>cloak can be equipped as accoutrements<cf>at any one time.
Aside from basic protective gear, you may<cf>also find full-body outfits that can be<cf>equipped to the Torso.
Donning one of these outfits will remove<cf>all other equipment, except for jewelry.
You are unable to use some items while<cf>engaged in strenuous physical activity.
You cannot change equipment in the midst<cf>of combat, so make sure you are fully<cf>prepared before the battle begins.
You cannot carry a burden that exceeds<cf>your own weight.
A heavy load will cause your Stamina to<cf>deplete more quickly. Sell or discard<cf>any and all items you no longer need.
You can send excess items to the Gran<cf>Soren storehouse from any resting spot.
Changing vocations comes with a cost to<cf>your discipline, so weigh the decision<cf>carefully before you commit.
Each vocation accumulates its own<cf>separate discipline total.
Discipline points can be spent to<cf>learn useful augments and skills.
Skills and augments must be enabled in<cf>order to make use of them.
Your lantern consumes oil. If it dims,<cf>use a Flask of Oil to refill it.
Some items can be combined with others to<cf>produce surprising results. Experiment and<cf>see what you come up with. 
You may find shops or travelling merchants<cf>selling especially rare goods.
Some peddlers only accept rift crystals.<cf>They often carry uncommon items you'll<cf>not see for sale anywhere else.
You can dash by clicking in <TUTO><SIZE 24><ICON PAD_L3></SIZE>,<cf>both during and outside of combat.
You can dash by clicking in <SIZE 24><ICON PAD_L3></SIZE>,<cf>both during and outside of combat.
Weapons need not always be held at the<cf>ready. Certain weapons can be sheathed.
Carrying your weapon unsheathed decreases<cf>your movement speed, but reduces damage<cf>taken from ambushes and surprise attacks.
Select "Status" from the Pause Menu to<cf>view details on your current condition.
Place waypoint markers on your map to<cf>keep track of your progress.
If you've forgotten where you are in the story,<cf>select "Chronicle" from the Pause Menu to<cf>review a history of your journey thus far.
Select "History" from the Pause Menu to<cf>view a log of your pawns' messages.
Consult the "History" in the Pause Menu<cf>to view a record of all the pawns you've<cf>employed.
Select "Options" from the Pause Menu to<cf>customize your mini-map and status display.
You can raise your affinity with people by<cf>giving them items or completing the quests<cf>they ask of you.
Affinity affects how people talk and<cf>behave toward you.
Break any law, and you may find yourself<cf>arrested and imprisoned.
You can't use items or change equipment in<cf>the castle dungeons, with few exceptions.
You are free once more, and can use items<cf>and change equipment as usual.
You can speak with and enlist the pawns<cf>you encounter in town or out on the roads.
Regulations forbid pawns from entering the<cf>duke's castle.
When you visit the castle, your pawns will<cf>wait outside and rejoin you when you leave.
Be wary near any body of water. Wade too<cf>deep and you might be enveloped by the<cf>fog-like monster known as the Brine.
Wander too deep or idle too long in the<cf>water and you'll fall unconscious, washing<cf>ashore later at some faraway place. 
Certain items automatically become other<cf>items once you acquire a set amount of them.
The Black Cat deals in rare goods that<cf>cannot be found in normal shops.
If you misplace an important item, you may<cf>find it for sale here later.
The Black Cat can also create counterfeit<cf>versions of certain items for you.
These forgeries look just like, but do not<cf>possess the powers of, the real thing.<cf>Still, such items do have their uses...
If your party is overloaded, speak with a<cf>storehouse keeper to deposit items and<cf>equipment.
Anything in storage can be retrieved from<cf>any storehouse in the world.
You can also send items to storage from any<cf>resting spot. Keep your inventory neat and<cf>organized, and avoid being weighed down.
If a pawn possesses the right knowledge<cf>and skills, they may be able to assist<cf>you in tandem attacks.
Press <TUTO><SIZE 28><ICON LIFT></SIZE> to grab on to -- and climb <cf>upon -- larger monsters, at some cost<cf>to your Stamina.
Equipping armor meant for warriors of a<cf>significantly higher level than your own<cf>will drain your Stamina more quickly.
Press <TUTO><SIZE 28><ICON PAD_ST></SIZE> to bring up the Pause Menu,<cf>where you can check your attributes, a full<cf>map, quest information, and more.
Click in <TUTO><SIZE 24><ICON PAD_L3></SIZE> to dash.<cf>Any place outside of towns,<cf>dashing will consume Stamina.
You can control the camera with <SIZE 23><ICON PAD_RS></SIZE>.
Click in <SIZE 24><ICON PAD_R3></SIZE> to reset<cf>the camera's position.
The higher the fall, the more damage you<cf>will suffer.
Pressing <TUTO><SIZE 28><ICON STAT_CHANGE></SIZE> will draw your<cf>primary weapon.
Note that you move somewhat slower while<cf>your weapon is drawn.
Exhausting all Stamina will make you unable<cf>to act for a time. Take care to conserve<cf>energy!
You can attack while clinging to foes.
Petrifaction cannot be cured by normal<cf>magick, and is fatal if left untreated.
Use Secret Softener or the like to<cf>cure any petrified allies.
Your rank within a vocation rises as you<cf>defeat foes and complete quests. At higher<cf>ranks, a broader variety of skills are available.
Defeating foes and completing quests earns<cf>you more discipline, boosting your prowess<cf>in a vocation.
It's only here you can enable the skills<cf>and augments you learn. You cannot change<cf>them out in the field.
Pawns will collect and use items of their<cf>own volition.
You cannot carry or purchase items that<cf>would cause you to exceed your maximum<cf>encumbrance.
Core skills are enabled as soon as they<cf>are learned.
Press <TUTO><SIZE 25><ICON TOUCH></SIZE> while climbing down a ladder<cf>to descend quickly. 
Check the Options menu to toggle whether<cf>or not your mini-map rotates as you turn.
Dash forward (press <SIZE 24><ICON PAD_L3></SIZE>)<cf>to stay ahead of the dragon.
Strike at the dragon while avoiding its<cf>fiery breath.
Use <ICON PAD_RS> to aim the ballista,<cf>and press <ICON SHOT> to fire.
<TUTO>Press <SIZE 25><ICON ATTACK0></SIZE> or <SIZE 25><ICON ATTACK1></SIZE> to change arrows.
When near walls or ledges, press <TUTO><SIZE 25><ICON LIFT></SIZE> at<cf>just the right time to grab on.
Leap into the Everfall to explore the next<cf>area of the ruins.
Your main pawn will earn rift crystals<cf>while online in other worlds. Encourage<cf>other players to enlist your minion!
If a pawn remains unconscious for too long,<cf>they will be forfeit.
Your support pawn has become forfeit, and<cf>returned to the realm whence they came.
Your main pawn has become forfeit,<cf>disappearing and returning to the rift.
You cannot join covenants with other pawns<cf>while your main pawn is forfeit.
Touch any riftstone to return your lost<cf>main pawn to your side.
If a support pawn is forfeit, any items<cf>they were carrying are sent to item storage.
You can send off departing pawns with a<cf>single item as a gift for their creator.
Forfeit pawns forget any new information<cf>learned on their journey.
People who bear an icon above their head<cf>possess special information.
Those bearing green icons have new quests<cf>to offer.
People with red icons appearing over their<cf>heads have information relevant to your<cf>priority quest.
Sit at this special chair to mentor your<cf>main pawn.
For certain powerful magicks, incanting<cf>the same spell as a pawn will shorten the<cf>time required to cast it.
Touching this unique riftstone will allow<cf>you to battle the Ur-Dragon.
Downloadable content includes extra<cf>weapons, armor and more.
Some downloadable content can make your<cf>journey easier.
If you come upon a pawn equipped with<cf>strange or unfamiliar equipment, it<cf>could be downloadable content.
You can purchase downloadable content<cf>from the <NS>.
You can purchase downloadable content<cf>from the Xbox Live Marketplace.
Don't forget to enable skills and augments<cf>for your main pawn as well.
You can pass items to and from your pawns<cf>on the sub menu.
If you continue on, you will not be able to<cf>return for some time. Make sure you're<cf>amply prepared.
Performing actions that people dislike will<cf>decrease their affinity for you.
Your movement rate slows while in watery<cf>areas like rivers or bogs. Additionally,<cf>stepping into or near some areas can<cf>inflict debilitations.
It is difficult to move in very windy areas.<cf>However, heavier people will be less affected<cf>by the resistance.

This is a rift...a space between realms<cf>from which any and all manner of pawns<cf>may be found.
Touching the stone allows you to seek and<cf>summon pawns, or return to your realm.
If you've mistakenly lost or sold an<cf>important item, try checking the curiosities<cf>shop in Gran Soren.
Items you are looking for have a way of<cf>turning up as part of the Black Cat's<cf>inventory.
Should one catch your eye, speak with<cf>the pawn to enlist it to your party.
You may hire only two pawns on to your<cf>party at any one time. They can then be<cf>discharged by speaking with them again.
With money and the right materials,<cf>all weapons and armor but jewelry<cf>may be enhanced.
If you haven't sufficient materials on<cf>hand, the remainder will be automatically<cf>taken from your item storage.

To receive the effects of curative magicks,<cf>step within the area of the healing light.
You may now take on Wyrm Hunt quests.<cf>Head to the castle gates in Gran Soren's<cf>noble quarter, and speak with Ser Maximilian.
It is time for you to begin your journey as<cf>Arisen. But before you can win your heart<cf>back from the dragon, you'll need to prepare...
Begin by asking around the village for clues.<cf>Someone ought to be able to point you in<cf>the right direction.
To truly know what Arisen are meant to do,<cf>'tis likely best to follow the pawn's lead.
Finally, you set out from the village of your<cf>youth. Take to the roads and head for the<cf>encampment.
Mercedes has taken the hydra head to offer<cf>as tribute to the duke. Head for the Mountain<cf>Waycastle and help her escort it.
There is plenty of information on the dragon<cf>to be found in Gran Soren. Take on some<cf>quests and explore the city.
Having met with the duke, you may now take<cf>on Royal Orders. Seek out Chamberlain<cf>Aldous within the palace.
You cannot allow the Elysion's plots to<cf>come to pass. Head for the Greatwall and<cf>stop Salvation!
You have felled the dragon and completed<cf>your goal! Report your victory to the<cf>villagers.
You've felled the dragon, but what has<cf>become of Gran Soren? After speaking with<cf>the villagers, best to see for yourself.
You progress through the game by<cf>completing quests. Always talk with the<cf>people you meet. They'll surely have<cf>aught for you to do.
If you've come to an impasse in a quest, try<cf>setting it as your priority quest to ensure<cf>you receive helpful hints and information.
Different pawns have different strengths, so<cf>use support pawns to tailor your party to fit<cf>your current needs.
Ecbal, located in the command headquarters<cf>of the encampment, provides many different<cf>support functions to adventurers.
Speak with him to rest and heal your wounds,<cf>learn and enable useful weapon skills, or<cf>store excess items.
This inn serves as a guild for local<cf>adventurers. Speak with innkeep Asalam to<cf>recover health, learn skills, and manage<cf>your stored items.
Additionally, once you've grown enough as<cf>Arisen, you will be able to change vocations here.
At times, people offering helpful services<cf>can be found at the campgrounds scattered<cf>around Gransys.
Speak with them to manage skills and<cf>augments, and store items while out in<cf>the field.
You may see peddlers hawking their wares as<cf>you make your way around Gransys.
They often come across rare items not found<cf>at more stationary shops. If you see a<cf>peddler, make sure to check what they have<cf>to offer.
Return to a rift or speak with pawns you<cf>meet to hire on a new support pawn.
Having been recognized as Arisen, you<cf>have been granted a loyal pawn to be your<cf>constant companion in your journey.
In addition to this main pawn, you may hire<cf>up to two other pawns to support you in<cf>your adventures.
As you take damage, the amount of Health<cf>you can recover through magick in the field<cf>also decreases, indicated by a white bar.
Rest at an inn or use curative items to fully<cf>recover your Health.
Periodically, tutorials will display to help<cf>smooth your progress through the game.
Reading the tutorials will provide you with<cf>gameplay advice and strategies.
You can toggle tutorial display in the<cf>Options section of the Pause Menu.
Seasoned adventurers may want to turn off<cf>tutorials and make their way through<cf>Gransys on their own.
This world is filled with different locations<cf>such as towns, fields, and caverns, all of<cf>which you may visit freely.
When you are uncertain how to proceed or<cf>cannot seem to defeat an especially strong<cf>foe, try a different location or quest.
Search for new locations, untried equipment<cf>or items, and people you've never met. As<cf>you learn, more experiences will become available.
There is no one "right" way to complete this<cf>adventure. Set yourself toward attempting to<cf>defeat the dragon, and blaze your own path.
Equipping weapons meant for adventurers of a<cf>significantly higher level than your own<cf>will drain your Stamina more quickly.
Giving pawns curatives to hold will allow<cf>them to use them at their own discretion.
In addition to minding level and available<cf>skills, a pawn's knowledge is another<cf>important part of creating an effective<cf>party.
Pawns with appropriate knowledge of quests<cf>or foes can provide helpful advice and battle<cf>strategies.
You can give direction on how you would like<cf>them to act in battle, and while out in the field.
Similarly, you can also advise your main pawn<cf>how you would have them speak to you.
A pawn's status can be determined by its icons.<cf><SIZE 32><ICON ONLINE></SIZE> means the pawn is online.<cf><SIZE 32><ICON FRIEND></SIZE> is a friend's pawn.<cf><SIZE 32><ICON BORROW></SIZE> is a pawn you've enlisted in the past.
Pawns take on different colors based on their status:<cf>Pawns with active covenants are shown in blue,<cf>pawns you have just summoned in orange, and<cf>pawns you are <KEEP>retaining in white.
Your Favorites list has a maximum size of 100 pawns.<cf>After that, to register another pawn, older pawns<cf>must be deleted from the registry.

Among the armaments you can purify are<cf>rings that will enhance your weapon<cf>skills.
To put them to use, equip the ring after<cf>learning the corresponding weapon skill.
Some of the items found on Bitterblack <cf>Isle have been cursed with powerful <cf>magicks. Whilst so blighted, their <cf>merits will not be apparent.
There's someone here at the bay, name of<cf>Olra... She knows a fair bit about<cf>removing curses.

The purified items have all been sent to storage.<cf>Be sure to check and see what items you've acquired.

Such frailty ill becomes a wife of the seas...
Nngh... It hurts...
Slave to a broken order... dare you look<cf>upon the truth?
Ah!
Eyah!
Aaaaah...
Nh!
Eagh!
Salutations, ser.
Pray, be well.
Yes...
No...
You have my thanks, ser.
I thank you from the very bottom of my heart.
Hail, road-weary warrior. Well met.
Do you seek the duke? I should think him at work in his solar at this hour.
I fear I know precious little of war and its waging.
I am filled with fear, dear warrior.
Fear of the dragon, fear of my husband... In truth, I know not which frightens me more.
Hail, road-weary warrior. Well met.
Do you seek the duke? I should think him at work in his solar at this hour.
I fear I know precious little of war and its waging.
...
Ser...
...
Good ser, we mustn't linger so...
The castle walls have eyes, and there are those who would misconstrue our friendship.
I shall pray for your safe travels, ser.
Until we meet again, dear Arisen...
I am filled with fear, dear warrior.
Fear of the dragon, fear of my husband... In truth, I know not which frightens me more.
I...
...
I must confess, I...
For a time, I'd hoped you would come and take me from this awful place.
But now the dragon is come again, and that hope is lost.
What an exquisite ring! ...Is this for me?
I thank you, dear warrior! 'Tis truly a thing of beauty.
I much prefer it to the bauble I received from the duke.
For me? You are far too kind, dear warrior.
I shall cherish it.
You are ever my knight in gleaming armor. You championed me against the wyrm itself!
I couldn't abide living in this cursed land any longer...
But as I fled, I was captured by the dragon. I near lost all hope entirely. I was deathly afraid.
In truth, I was afraid even of returning home.
My father would never abide my having sundered the marriage he crafted.
There was a time I even considered death...
But when the moment came...there, in the dragon's talons, I found myself calling out to you.
And you came.
You have saved me, ser, and not just with steel and valor.
I fear my words fail me... You have saved my all, my dearest warrior. My great redeemer.
Enough!
A master and his pawn, is it?
You'll be quite the force, come the day you learn to fight as one.
Mind you, that's a skill better honed in practice than in the heat of mortal combat.
I can help in that regard, should you wish it.
Ahh, 'tis a fine band you've assembled. Wasted no time in taking my advice, eh?
Still, 'tis experience that makes a fellow fit to fight.
Beg a lesson from Captain Mercedes, ser. She'll steer you true.
I am he who treads where death fears walk.
We are the Nameless Men.
Your life belongs to us.
Ah, the venerable Arisen returns...
Are you come to lead the pawns<cf>in a quest to slay the dragon?
Those equivocal husks? 
Will or nill, the Arisen is always<cf>drawn to the dragon,
as puppets strung in fate's own thread.
Many have come before you,
eager to stand tall atop the grand capstone<cf>of worldly truth that is the dragon...
Arrogance!
The dragon is ever born anew into the world,<cf>and with it, too, the Arisen.
All Arisen seek out the dragon,
but lucky are the few who attain<cf>an audience with the beast...
...while yet they live.
Ours is a weak, fragile world, and<cf>little within it is more frail than man.
In yon encampent they gather up<cf>their knights and hired steel... 
They think to grow their numbers<cf>and hunt the dragon...
But they shall soon learn their lot<cf>will e'er be as prey.
Ah!
Aanh!
Eaaaagh!
Ya!
Eyaah!
Oh, hello.
Till next time.
Mm, yes.
No...
Thank you.
You're apt to make me blush, cos.
It's a mercy so much of the village was spared.
Had the beast landed any further inland, this shop would be flat as a plank now.
Makes me ill just to think of it.
There's little sense in staying open with so few people about, I know...
Old habits die hard, eh?
I do hope the others come back home to the village soon...
What's this about the pawns?
I can't say as I favor their lot much.
There's just no telling what's in those pawns' heads, eh?
And I don't trust anyone who'll happily follow orders to his death. It's...unnatural.
Don't trouble yourself, cos. The matter's resolved.
A hydra, you say!?
The woods are brimming with beasties, seems like. Hydras, the dragon...
The likes of me can only spend her days fretting and praying, praying and fretting...
There are times I wonder what's the point being born at all, truth be told.
You've started off on a proper journey, then?
I'm envious, but you won't see a simple girl like me setting out on her own.
Alone on those roads... I'd not last the week, like as not.
Even if the dragon were come tomorrow, I've no place to run.
So I stay here, and long as I'm here, I'll run my shop.
Welcome back! How fares your journey?
It's as I always say: The likes of me could never brave the roads alone...
And I can't run, even knowing the dragon's upon us and this land may soon be glass and ash.
All us weak folk can do is sit and fret.
Or d'you suppose I'm only weak for never trying?
Met with the duke then, have you?
Edmun was an Arisen himself once, I hear it told.
Went off on his own journey, and slew the dragon at its end.
Swords 'n sorcery... It's the stuff of dreams and nursey tales for a girl like me.
But you, who knows? You may be duke yourself afore all's said and done.
I'd be a liar if I said the dragon didn't have me scared...
But there's nothing says we're all doomed for certain now it's upon us, is there?
True enough, a dragon put the west of Gransys to ruin long ago.
But the east survived. The duke slew the beast and saved the land.
Seems to me there's no sure way to know whether we'll be snatched up by the wyrm or no.
If that's so, the dragon's no more a threat than disease or aught else what can kill a man.
The dragon, slain by human hand...
It's all too grand to take in. It has the feel of a dream.
Even with the dragon gone, there's plenty of beast still eager to make a meal'a you.
Or, failing that, disease and injury can still end a life easy<cf>enough...
But listen to me whinge and moan. This is good news! We ought to celebrate!
And afore that, we ought to thank you.
To think on it now, I've been here going about my business the same all along.
The dragon's coming didn't change much, and its dying changed less still.
I'm sure if aught other threat arises, life will keep on just the same.
Just me here in my shop, waiting for the storm to pass...
Thinking on the rut I'm in...I'm no different from the pawns, am I?
I'd thought pawns strange and kept my distance all this while...
But I suppose they're closer to the rest of us than all that, eh?
Aught I can help you with, cos?
Aught I can help you with, cos?
Don't let me rush you, now.
Decided, have you?
Sorry, cos. That's not quite enough.
Comes to about this much.
It's in good hands.
This one, aye?
All right.
Sorry, cos.
You're apt to make me blush, cos.
<SHOP>I only wish I had more to offer.

The injured will die without those flowers.
Seems we need search by day and night both.
We ought search by day and night.
The flowers which bloom by day<cf>favor the roots of large trees.
There's a tree beyond that may<cf>foster some sunbright.
We ought search the shore<cf>by night for moonglow.
We need seek out moonglow.
They say the moonglow blooms anights<cf>where the sea breeze blows...
We'll not find sunbright except by day.
I saw flowers blooming by the sea anights...
'Twould be wise to pack curatives<cf>if we aim to leave Cassardis.
'Tis a grand tree.
A flower... Shall we take it?
We'll have need of a lantern<cf>if we hope to search by night.
Seems we're most like to find what we seek<cf>near trees.
Do not become so lost in your search you<cf>give your back to monsters, Arisen.
Perhaps we ought to search the shore as well.
Let's walk down to the shore, Master.<cf>We may find what we seek there.
This area's a likely place for a flower.<cf>Let's take a look around.
I hear the moonglow attracts moths by night.
There is a tree on the hillside, is there not?
We're like to find a flower by<cf>the grand tree ahead.
Aye, 'tis the flower we seek.
This is moonglow. I'm certain of it.
What of the flower hunt, Master?<cf>We mustn't keep her waiting.
We'd best make haste if these flowers<cf>are to help the injured...
There, on the table. Is that the flower we seek?
'Tis like growing around the village. Let's search near any trees.
Thank the Maker you yet live! I have not the words to apologize for your suffering.
The duke was furious at news of our actions, as I'm sure you might imagine.
In his rage, he banished milady Aelinore to the lonely northern manse...
Now she fears her husband will have her killed! Her very life is in jeopardy, Arisen!
We must take our next move before his... We plan to flee, and seek refuge in our native Meloire.
Please, Arisen -- make for the manse and find the duchess, else she find an assassin's blade. Rescue her.
I have a set of soldier's equipment I stole away for you.
Wear it to enter the manse without attracting the attentions of the Guard.
Please, Arisen, I beg of you: make for the northern manse with all speed!
You mustn't be discovered, ser, and above all, keep your identity well hid!
If they know the truth of it, my mistress will face terrible repercussions!
You must speed for the Stone of the North, ser!
So the task was too great, even for the Arisen...
'Tis over, then. I'll be hunted down myself, for what life I have left... Maker preserve me...
What is that thing!?
Graaagh!
There was a dragon about, I tell you! ...No, I have not been drinking!
The beast flew off toward the Tainted Mountain. ...I've not had so much as a drop today, I swear on it!
Arisen, eh? Been a lot of "Arisens" wandering the streets of late.
Plenty folks are all too eager to offer drink or coin to any who name themselves Arisen, whether they rate the title or no.
You'd best live up to your title. Prove false and like as not you'll lose your head along with our trust.
You know the Tainted Mountain, yeah? Where the dragon flew off to?
The Tainted Mountain was the very place Duke Edmun fought the dragon long ago. 
I suppose you'll be scaling that mountain yourself sooner or<cf>later. Seeing as how you're the Arisen and all. 
The Greatwall? 'Course I've heard of it! It's right at the base of the Tainted Mountain.
Everyone seems to think the Greatwall will protect us. But what good's a wall when your enemy can soar right over it?
I'm no scholar when it comes to magick and prophesy and so on, but...you did defeat the dragon, yeah?
Can't fathom why you're jabbering on with the likes of me -- best get that news to Duke Edmun.
Ah, I hoped to see you this day, cos. I have aught I would tell you:
I have chosen to forgo the fishing life so I might travel the land and study its wonders.
As such, I had hoped you might assist in preparations for my journey. How does this offer find you?
Help out
Not now
I truly will always be in your debt, cos...
Afore all else, I must provision myself for the trek.
I need goods that restore energy. Something to speed my steps when exhaustion creeps 'round.
Might you find me some such healing items?
No? Ah... Well, I will require more time afore I set off but...so be it. 
Please find me should you reconsider.
Oh, are you going to help me prepare for my journey after all?
Help out
Not now
I know that healing items are of utmost import...and I do have a knack for needing them. Best not to be stingy.
Perfect. These should keep me from getting into too much trouble...at least, when you aren't around to save me.
Now, what's next, what's next... Ah! Yes, of course:
Some source of light. My travels will mostlike take me to caves and other dark places, you know...
How could I forget a light source? My mind must be<cf>going south...
Many thanks. I needn't fear any darkness with this at my side.
Is there else I require... Ah! Food! Of course.
It's not that I'm picky, I just don't know what's fit to eat other than fish. Might you find something I can bring, cos?
I'd best bring as much food as possible. If I must eat alone, I ought to at least eat well!
Ah, this should be food enough. My thanks, cos.
That should take care of the essentials...but might I beg one final request?
A good-luck charm, to guard me on the roads. I can't always depend on you, after all.
Ill fortune will doubtless visit my journey at some point.
A good-luck charm would steady my resolve.
Aha! Yes! It's perfect!
This should be all. I believe I finally have everything I need to set off.
Please, cos: Join me in a drink, as thanks for your kindness.
Hmm... This is more baggage than I imagined.
I had planned to pack sparingly, but see now that proper caution cannot be taken lightly.
Beg forgive me cos, but one more favor? Could I trouble you to take my things to the shore?
I'm sorry for all the bother. Truly.
I would not have troubled you again if my provisions were not so dear to me.
Fantastic! That is well and truly everything.
I have stolen too much of your time, and yet can give only thanks in return.
Er...right, then! ...Bit rough there, weren't you, cos? But...'tis well enough.
I thought we would ne'er be through. My thanks, goodfisher.

There is no staying fate, I know, but to see one's own master slain before you...
Pray, do not inflict the same sorrow upon another... Take care.
Maker be good... Are you the Arisen, ser? I am of the party sent to survey the ruins.
I've seen no sign of Brother Jean -- he had gone on ahead...
I dearly wish I could run to his aid, but as you've seen...I am the Faith's greatest craven.
I beseech you, ser! Find Jean within and see him safe!
I dread for Brother Jean gone on ahead... Please, go and see him safe!
Jean... Dead... I... I see.
I... I do not wish his death to be in vain, ser. I will do all I can...
Please. Might you survey these ruins in his stead, Arisen?
That he may know some small comfort in seeing his work here completed, I ask your aid, ser.
Brother Jean possessed a part that fixed to a device within the ruins.
If you did not find it on his...with him there, then it must be in the ruins somewhere.
Pray, find it and put it to good use. He'd have wished the same...
Sites such as these often house engraved slates and other ancient texts.
Some have held revelations of vast importance. If you see any within, pray, bring them to me.
Oft times, age will splinter the slates. It is critical you retrieve every piece of the whole.
Mm, yes... As the slate is joined together, the text becomes clear.
I will not rest until its meaning is deciphered, ser. ...For the sake of Brother Jean.
The Faith will see it done. In that you may believe.
You have my thanks, Arisen. I shall break the sad news of Brother Jean's sacrifice to Father Geffrey myself.
It was no fault of yours, ser. You've done your duty by us well, as the Father shall hear.
Pray, do not let it weigh upon your heart. Go and tell Ser Maximilian of our success.
There's no way forward save crossing<cf>here.
We must ford this river to reach the<cf>witch's cottage.
'Tis shallow enough to cross.
Tis some manner of ward...
Hmm, I see no way to stop the thing...
If we destroy it, the miasma should<cf>clear.
Then, this is the witch's cottage?
The girl known as the witch is here.
A grave...?
The woman who rests here was once an<cf>Arisen, like you.
Arisen and pawns share a rare bond...
'Tis a curious stone, is it not?
That seems no common rock...
We're at a disadvantage fighting in<cf>the marsh.
Well thick, this forest.
The wood is uncommon dense...almost<cf>as if it means to hide aught away.
Perhaps we'll find more of the<cf>witch's legacy here.
The forests of southern Gransys are<cf>ever shrouded in this thick mist.
'Tis a place rich in valuable<cf>resources...
But stray a few steps, and you'll be<cf>well lost, even in the noontime sun.
Few people are willing to take such<cf>risks, even for lucre.
Yet, for all the danger, this<cf>pawn feels quite comfortable here.
Magick...or aught similar,<cf>hangs thick in the air.
Must you go? You'll be alone... Naught but solitude lies beyond.
You're not without a home to return to.
Why? What is it drives you so?
Ser Mercedes came through afore you arrived.
We were told to stop her, but the wench won past us...
I'd thought her but an ornament, yet the woman is strong as a boar, and twice as stubborn.
You are blind to the truth, Arisen!
Perdition is nigh! The hour of redemption is upon us!
All will burn, and through fire return to nothingness!
In the name of Salvation, the world must know chaos. The world must know destruction!
Waaugh...
Our numbers are nothing before it... Nothing...!
Even dragons die. Felling a griffin should be simple enough.
We'll defeat it... We must.
Keep your eyes on the beast!
I'm...wounded!
Tell me, ser. What is to become of my father?
You're the Arisen, are you not? Can you not do aught to help him!?
I could not bear to lose him...
Even if the things they say were true, I still... He was ever a kind father to me.
A petition? Of course, I would gladly draft one.
I would draft a hundred, if it be a help.
I believe in my father's innocence, Arisen.
Please... Please, help him!
'Tis locked. You haven't the key to fit it...
'Tis caught on something. Perhaps it could open from the far side.
'Tis barred shut. Might be able to break the bolt.
'Tis shut tight.
'Tis no use at this hour. You'll have to come again later.
Best stop for now.
Seems they're closed.
Someone was here...
Lost them...
Gone...
Perhaps you've upset them.
There's naught to do here.
Best you moved on.
Not here...
The door is closed.
Shows no sign of opening.
There's aught there...
You don't see anything.
That smell...
Someone's near...
What's this...?
Fine view from here.
There's aught written here...
Must be a way to find something...
Smells delicious.
Perfect spot to place something.
You can almost reach...
There appears to be aught ahead.
That fall could kill.
'Tis dangerous to touch.
A strong blow might break it.
Perhaps if you came by night.
Perhaps if you came by day.
Perhaps if you came at dawn.
Perhaps if you came at dusk.
There's aught buried here...
You see no way up.
'Tis slick, this spot.
No use pressing any further.
No need to double back further.
No time for that now.
You cannot carry any more.
There may yet be aught lying about.
Seems there's naught you can take on at present.<cf>Best to try again later.
Perhaps with a bit of help...
Best you kept your weapon sheathed.
Is someone here...?
'Tis a place for tall folk.
'Tis a place for small folk.
Had you a woman in your band...
Had you a man in your band...
Had you a strong companion...
Had you a swift companion...
Had you a magick user...
Had you an apt climber...
Had you a skilled jumper...
This weapon will not help you.
That armor won't protect you.
You're ill equipped for this.
Seems it can't be used now.
You'll get no further use from it.
'Tis useless, now.
Hmm, not with your current equipment...
Not with your current party...
You hear aught from further in.
Enemies... They're close.
Best you got some rest.
You can carry no more!
You're too exhausted!
"Danger! Keep Out!"
"No Trespassing"
A sign.
Had you an Empty Flask, you might fill it here.
You'll get no further without a lantern.
'Tis dangerous to fumble about in the dark. Best find a light.
Best not just leave them.
If aught were left here, it would rot.
Best take care you don't get lost.
Best check the map.
You're due for a rest.
This place is dangerous by night.
This place is dangerous by day.
Breathtaking...
You'll get no further!
Seems you'll need to come back.
Nothing left here.
It looks fit to crumble.
Seems it could be moved...
It will not budge.
It will not open.
Seems you need a key.
Seems you need a Pickaxe here.
You yet lack the experience.
You yet lack the skill.
Not with your current vocation...
You'll not pass through this gate.
You've no time!
Seems you were too late.
You may make it, yet.
You're doing well for time.
Seems you've come at the wrong time.
There may be another path.
Even headless, 'tis clear that spear's seen long years of use.
The wall bears an inscription...
"Seek the spear aimed at the hilltop sky..."
"The dragon's soul dwells e'er within the Arisen's breast..."
A Ferrystone will spirit you back to Gran<cf>Soren in an instant, no matter where you<cf>are located.
It is by far the fastest and safest method<cf>of travel, but each stone disappears after<cf>a single use.
You can equip yourself with a primary and<cf>a secondary weapon.
Primary weapons such as swords and daggers<cf>are combat essentials. Secondary weapons<cf>like bows and shields offer support.
In addition to weapons and armor, you can<cf>also equip accoutrements with certain special<cf>abilities to give you an edge in battle.
Only one piece of jewelry and a single<cf>cloak can be equipped as accoutrements<cf>at any one time.
A heavy load will cause your Stamina to<cf>deplete more quickly. Sell or discard<cf>any and all items you no longer need.
Your lantern consumes oil. If it dims,<cf>use a Flask of Oil to refill it.
Some items can be combined with others to<cf>produce surprising results. Experiment and<cf>see what you come up with. 
Place waypoint markers on your map to<cf>keep track of your progress.
If you've forgotten where you are in the story,<cf>select "Chronicle" from the Pause Menu to<cf>review a history of your journey thus far.
Select "Options" from the Pause Menu to<cf>customize your mini-map and status display.
The higher the fall, the more damage you<cf>will suffer.
Note that you move somewhat slower while<cf>your weapon is drawn.
Exhausting all Stamina will make you unable<cf>to act for a time. Take care to conserve<cf>energy!
You can attack while clinging to foes.
Petrifaction cannot be cured by normal<cf>magick, and is fatal if left untreated.
Use Secret Softener or the like to<cf>cure any petrified allies.
Your rank within a vocation rises as you<cf>defeat foes and complete quests. At higher<cf>ranks, a broader variety of skills are available.
Defeating foes and completing quests earns<cf>you more discipline, boosting your prowess<cf>in a vocation.
Pawns will collect and use items of their<cf>own volition.
You cannot carry or purchase items that<cf>would cause you to exceed your maximum<cf>encumbrance.
Press <TUTO><SIZE 25><ICON TOUCH></SIZE> while climbing down a ladder<cf>to descend quickly. 
If a pawn remains unconscious for too long,<cf>they will be forfeit.
Your support pawn has become forfeit, and<cf>returned to the realm whence they came.
Your main pawn has become forfeit,<cf>disappearing and returning to the rift.
You cannot join covenants with other pawns<cf>while your main pawn is forfeit.
Touch any riftstone to return your lost<cf>main pawn to your side.
If a support pawn is forfeit, any items<cf>they were carrying are sent to item storage.
You can send off departing pawns with a<cf>single item as a gift for their creator.
You can pass items to and from your pawns<cf>on the sub menu.
Bugger off!
What are you lookin' at?
Off with ye!
Lookin' to bleed, are ye?
I've naught to say to you.
If you've no business here, move on.
Best mind what you do here.
What is it?
'Ow's the road treating you, cousin?
Come to join our little band?
What do you think you're doing here?
...Why are you still in my presence?
What is your problem, friend?
May I have no respite from you?
I love intruders. Gives me a chance to work on my bladework.
Don't think I won't take the opportunity to put you in your place.
How can I be free of this clouted barnacle!?
I'd wager your head is even harder than my steel.
If all work were as slack as Arisening must be, I might've kept a legal job!
You may be the most mule-headed person I've ever met.
How go your travails?
Hallo!
Audacious harlots...spawned from the dragon himself!
This really is the last straw, this time.
...For true?
Now...now is the time to strike, for true and for all.
'Tis merely a question of how, when, and where...
Mm-hmm...
What?
Understood...
Then?
What need has the duke for tribute, at such a cost?
Merciful Maker...

A broken riftstone. Looks like you might be<cf>able to restore it by using rift crystals.
Restore the riftstone?<cf>Current rift crystals: <RIMS><cf>Rift crystal cost: <RIM2>
You haven't enough rift crystals to restore it.
Yes
No
This seems a safe enough spot...<cf>Care to rest awhile?
It won't open.<cf>It seems to be linked to some sort of mechanism.
Master!
...MASTER!
It is you... Isn't it?
Of course it is. I'm sorry.
You just seemed...changed.
But I suppose it isn't you who's different.
It's everything else, and you who changed it...
The other villagers may know something.
Perhaps one of the other villagers knows<cf>aught of Valmiro's whereabouts.
Look, there! Someone lies fallen!
...Will he be all right?
I don't know... We'd best go after him.
He certainly has a talent for passing out...
...I suppose we'd best help him. Again.
I've lost count... How many times does<cf>this make?
Not one like to survive in the wilds, is he?
Tis almost impressive, the degree to<cf>which his ambition outstrips his means...
He's safely on his way. Let's make for<cf>Cassardis ourselves, to tell Merin.
Merin will be happy to hear he's safe.
I wonder if Valmiro ever made it back<cf>here?
I do hope Valmiro isn't off lying bloodied<cf>on the roadside somewhere...
Seemed nice enough; I hope he won't pass<cf>out in too many ditches in our absence.
'Tis Valmiro, Arisen, though it pains me<cf>to say it...
That there... 'Tis human, aye?
Tis Valmiro, Arisen. Again. 'Tis less work<cf>minding a child...
I do wish he'd settle down... At least we<cf>have word of his next destination.
Mother!
I'm scared...
My greatest regret is that I will not see my<cf>homeland rebuilt.
Forgive me, my brothers... I take our dreams<cf>now to my grave.
I am not afeared to die in this place... But I<cf>would not wish this fate on any other.
Hail, dear warrior of the lovely helm.
I fear I am remiss in asking your name, ser.
Arisen...? You must forgive me. I fear I am grossly ignorant in matters of war.
I had thought all who fought shared the title "warrior."
But again, you must excuse me. I am Aelinore, come just a few days past as a bride to the duke.
I pray you will serve my lord husband faithfully, ser warrior.
I presume the crown you bear is a mark of your station as the Arisen?
I must apologize for my laughter, good ser. I assure you I meant no disrespect.
You would gift me your crown, dear warrior? You are far too kind.
I shall cherish it.
I shall pray for your safe travels, ser.
Until we meet again, dear Arisen...

Valmiro... Forgive me, ser -- I've yet to meet all the people of this village.
Though...one moment. I did see a young fisherman not unlike you describe, near the shore.
Seemed a kind enough lad, if a bit...unawares? As if his mind was elsewhere.
To the Arisen! May the path ahead e'er be clear!
I cannot fathom His Grace's mind in this...
'Tis a queer mood hangs 'round the castle these days, don't you agree?
Let us speak another time, ser.
I'm sure others can't wait to meet you, why don't you find out?
I'm on watch just now. Pray, leave me to it.
Spoken with Captain Daerio?
He's a quiet one, wise and temperate. Would that all men who lead were so.
I'm on watch just now. Pray, leave me to it.
What do you make of all this dragon business, Arisen?
'Tis imprudent to say, but... I fear there are those in Gran Soren would use it to draw attention from the failings of the duke's court.

'Tis locked. You haven't the key to fit it...
'Tis caught on something. Perhaps it could open from the far side.
'Tis barred shut. Might be able to break the bolt.
'Tis shut tight.
'Tis no use at this hour. You'll have to come again later.
Best stop for now.
Seems they're closed.
Someone was here...
Lost them...
Gone...
Perhaps you've upset them.
There's naught to do here.
Best you moved on.
Not here...
The door is closed.
Shows no sign of opening.
There's aught there...
You don't see anything.
That smell...
Someone's near...
What's this...?
Fine view from here.
There's aught written here...
Must be a way to find something...
Smells delicious.
Perfect spot to place something.
You can almost reach...
There appears to be aught ahead.
That fall could kill.
'Tis dangerous to touch.
A strong blow might break it.
Perhaps if you came by night.
Perhaps if you came by day.
Perhaps if you came at dawn.
Perhaps if you came at dusk.
There's aught buried here...
You see no way up.
'Tis slick, this spot.
No use pressing any further.
No need to double back further.
No time for that now.
You cannot carry any more.
There may yet be aught lying about.
Seems there's naught you can take on at present.<cf>Best to try again later.
Perhaps with a bit of help...
Best you kept your weapon sheathed.
Is someone here...?
'Tis a place for tall folk.
'Tis a place for small folk.
Had you a woman in your band...
Had you a man in your band...
Had you a strong companion...
Had you a swift companion...
Had you a magick user...
Had you an apt climber...
Had you a skilled jumper...
This weapon will not help you.
That armor won't protect you.
You're ill equipped for this.
Seems it can't be used now.
You'll get no further use from it.
'Tis useless, now.
Hmm, not with your current equipment...
Not with your current party...
You hear aught from further in.
Enemies... They're close.
Best you got some rest.
You can carry no more!
You're too exhausted!
"Danger! Keep Out!"
"No Trespassing"
A sign.
Had you an Empty Flask, you might fill it here.
You'll get no further without a lantern.
'Tis dangerous to fumble about in the dark. Best find a light.
Best not just leave them.
If aught were left here, it would rot.
Best take care you don't get lost.
Best check the map.
You're due for a rest.
This place is dangerous by night.
This place is dangerous by day.
Breathtaking...
You'll get no further!
Seems you'll need to come back.
Nothing left here.
It looks fit to crumble.
Seems it could be moved...
It will not budge.
It will not open.
Seems you need a key.
Seems you need a Pickaxe here.
You yet lack the experience.
You yet lack the skill.
Not with your current vocation...
You'll not pass through this gate.
You've no time!
Seems you were too late.
You may make it, yet.
You're doing well for time.
Seems you've come at the wrong time.
There may be another path.
'Tis a powerful weapon... Too bad it doesn't work.
Wakestones are miraculous items that can<cf>bring your character, pawn allies, or <cf>others back to life.
Treasure each Wakestone, for the fragments<cf>required to form them are quite rare, and<cf>each stone can only be used once.
Gather enough Wakestone Shards and<cf>they will automatically assemble to<cf>form a complete stone.
Your main pawn will earn rift crystals<cf>while online in other worlds. Encourage<cf>other players to enlist your minion!
A Ferrystone will spirit you back to Gran<cf>Soren in an instant, no matter where you<cf>are located.
It is by far the fastest and safest method<cf>of travel, but each stone disappears after<cf>a single use.
You can equip yourself with a primary and<cf>a secondary weapon.
Primary weapons such as swords and daggers<cf>are combat essentials. Secondary weapons<cf>like bows and shields offer support.
In addition to weapons and armor, you can<cf>also equip accoutrements with certain special<cf>abilities to give you an edge in battle.
Only one piece of jewelry and a single<cf>cloak can be equipped as accoutrements<cf>at any one time.
A heavy load will cause your Stamina to<cf>deplete more quickly. Sell or discard<cf>any and all items you no longer need.
Your lantern consumes oil. If it dims,<cf>use a Flask of Oil to refill it.
Some items can be combined with others to<cf>produce surprising results. Experiment and<cf>see what you come up with. 
Place waypoint markers on your map to<cf>keep track of your progress.
If you've forgotten where you are in the story,<cf>select "Chronicle" from the Pause Menu to<cf>review a history of your journey thus far.
Select "Options" from the Pause Menu to<cf>customize your mini-map and status display.
The higher the fall, the more damage you<cf>will suffer.
Note that you move somewhat slower while<cf>your weapon is drawn.
Exhausting all Stamina will make you unable<cf>to act for a time. Take care to conserve<cf>energy!
You can attack while clinging to foes.
Petrifaction cannot be cured by normal<cf>magick, and is fatal if left untreated.
Use Secret Softener or the like to<cf>cure any petrified allies.
Your rank within a vocation rises as you<cf>defeat foes and complete quests. At higher<cf>ranks, a broader variety of skills are available.
Defeating foes and completing quests earns<cf>you more discipline, boosting your prowess<cf>in a vocation.
Pawns will collect and use items of their<cf>own volition.
You cannot carry or purchase items that<cf>would cause you to exceed your maximum<cf>encumbrance.
Press <TUTO><SIZE 25><ICON TOUCH></SIZE> while climbing down a ladder<cf>to descend quickly. 
If a pawn remains unconscious for too long,<cf>they will be forfeit.
Your support pawn has become forfeit, and<cf>returned to the realm whence they came.
Your main pawn has become forfeit,<cf>disappearing and returning to the rift.
You cannot join covenants with other pawns<cf>while your main pawn is forfeit.
Touch any riftstone to return your lost<cf>main pawn to your side.
If a support pawn is forfeit, any items<cf>they were carrying are sent to item storage.
You can send off departing pawns with a<cf>single item as a gift for their creator.
You can pass items to and from your pawns<cf>on the sub menu.
In memory of Grette,
Silent-hearted, dragonforged.
With hair of gold and will of tempered steel.
You ransomed me from a village burnt to Ash--instilled life, and fight. Dearest mentor, I commend you now to rest eternal.
Your servant, bereft of master and memory,<cf>I keep now at my side.
She lives on, your mirror in soul and body both,<cf>and I will not lose her as we have lost you.
This I swear before your empty grave.
Let's see what we can learn from the<cf>townspeople.
Mason is said to frequent this area...
'Tis this way to Mason's den.
The man is far from trustworthy, but<cf>perhaps we should hear him out.
We'd best ask around the capital once<cf>more.
He said the catacomb entrance stands<cf>to the northwest.
We've found our entrance. With luck,<cf>we'll find Salvation within.
Here. 'Tis the place Salvation's said<cf>to meet. ...We had best tread softly.
Let's follow that voice to its source.
The voice grows clearer...
I heard a voice from beyond the door...
'Tis your choice to make, Arisen.
What was that!?
I do not trust him, master. Best we<cf>return with word of this.
Seems the door is held closed by some<cf>mechanism.
This lever likely opens a door.
Take care not to step on any stray<cf>bones.
What is this...
What dark, forgotten age saw this<cf>place built...?
The pawn legion make no graves.<cf>No need.
Still, 'tis clear even to me this is<cf>no normal burial site.
I daresay even if I lived here,<cf>I'd never feel at ease...
Hear that? It's someone speaking...
We are close...
'Twas sound judgment, Arisen.<cf>This was the only way.
Even had you spared him, doubtless<cf>Mason would not have shown such mercy.
'Tis not my place to question your<cf>judgment...
These are dark times brewing... <cf>Dark indeed.
It may be for the best. Knowing such<cf>a man would have only led to trouble.
Best we find this Meridith.
We'll like learn aught from Meridith.
Meridith lives among the slums.
Mason makes his home here in the<cf>slums.
We'll like hear more candid talk now<cf>we've that badge.
I'm certain Sairus knows something...
This road will deliver us to the<cf>catacombs.
This way to the catacombs, Arisen.
'Tis too dark to navigate without a<cf>torch.
'Tis dangerous to walk without a<cf>lantern.
I believe aught to light the way lies<cf>at the back of this room...
A lever, Arisen...
This lever may open the way to<cf>Salvation's meeting place.
Hmm... We may be able to get down.
Ought be a ladder nearby...
'Tis an unsettling voice...
We're nearly there.
Seems it won't budge. Let's move on.
'Tis shut fast. Must be a way up<cf>elsewhere.
We draw further from their meeting<cf>place.
Within lie the catacombs.<cf>Stay vigilant, Master.
Voices, Master! We draw near our<cf>quarry.
Mason keeps close track of Salvation's<cf>actions. He'll like be near the aqueduct.
The catacombs lie beyond the river, north<cf>of the capital. I remember them well.
'Tis a test of your resolve. Know that<cf>we shall follow, whatever you decide.
Be wary of the coffins, but let's continue on.<cf>We should find some manner of device further in.
Someone must know something about<cf>this matter. Let's ask around.
Let us return to the capital.
Not that way.
Let us check the map.
'Tis locked. You haven't the key to fit it...
'Tis caught on something. Perhaps it could open from the far side.
'Tis barred shut. Might be able to break the bolt.
'Tis shut tight.
'Tis no use at this hour. You'll have to come again later.

Something strong can be sensed from the stone. It <cf>appears the memories of someone have been etched<cf>upon the surface of the Monument of Remembrance.
Mnh.
Guhah!
Hnngh...
Dah!
Shaaah!
Hail.
As you like.
Mm.
Nay.
Kind of you.
You've my thanks.
The dragon? I welcome the beast.
Death in combat is but a final glory. Eh, young warrior?
Besides, running now brings no surety of a longer life.
So young friend, you're an Arisen, are you?
I envy you!
The Arisen have free run of the land.
You've the duke's dispensation to keep what coin and goods you come upon, besides.
Well, I suppose it has its price.
You stand first in line to feed the wyrm, for one.
How fare you, Arisen?
I'm sure you've heard tell the duke was an Arisen in his day.
In truth, he bears a great scar across his chest from his clash with the dragon.
How a man can slay a dragon, exactly, is well beyond my ken...
But just knowing it can happen sets my blood ablaze!
Seems it won't be long now till the beast is come...
You've my thanks.

Fine selection.
"Any who seek strength in body and mind are welcome at the training grounds. —Ser Berne"
'Tis lashed together tight with rope. Looks secure.
The logs are lashed together.
Food for the men of the Corps... Smells burnt.
The bag is heavy with sand. Used in training, most like.
'Tis no more than a sheet laid atop a crate.
Looks as if these are slated for repair. Best leave them be.
The space beyond has the look of a training ground.
A fellow could see for leagues from that<cf>watchtower.
A slab for summoning pawns. It lies still, for now...
The notice board. 'Tis wise to keep an eye on it for work.
Had you a bottle, you might take some of this with you.
'Tis more fragile than it looks. Best be gentle with it.
'Tis empty, now.
'Tis a powerful weapon... Too bad it doesn't work.
Only a stout blow'll break the likes of that.
Takes magick to break it, no doubt.
Now is hardly the time to flee.
As its said, best let sleeping dogs lie. Sleeping people, too.
You could attempt to strike up conversation...you just won't succeed.
Rifts allow you to search for and hire<cf>pawns that meet your particular needs.
Speak with a pawn to enlist him or her<cf>as a party member.
Materials collected during your travels<cf>can be used at shops or other locations<cf>to enhance your equipment. 
This is your main pawn, the companion you<cf>created as Arisen. It will forever act as<cf>your faithful servant.
Under your guidance, your main pawn will<cf>learn and evolve its skills and other<cf>behaviors in the course of your adventures.
These summoned pawns do not gain levels.<cf>Experience they earn transmutes into rift<cf>crystals when they return to their master.
Any item a summoned pawn equips will<cf>become a gift to their master when you<cf>relieve the pawn, and cannot be retrieved.
Notice boards across Gransys advertise<cf>quests -- errands and favors you can<cf>choose to undertake.
When you're connected online, your main<cf>pawn's attributes will be uploaded every<cf>time you rest at an inn.
Your main pawn will gain boons earned in<cf>other worlds at the inn, as well. Visit<cf>often to keep current on any developments.
Changing vocations comes with a cost to<cf>your discipline, so weigh the decision<cf>carefully before you commit.
Discipline points can be spent to<cf>learn useful augments and skills.
Skills and augments must be enabled in<cf>order to make use of them.
Some peddlers only accept rift crystals.<cf>They often carry uncommon items you'll<cf>not see for sale anywhere else.
Select "Status" from the Pause Menu to<cf>view details on your current condition.
Select "History" from the Pause Menu to<cf>view a log of your pawns' messages.
Consult the "History" in the Pause Menu<cf>to view a record of all the pawns you've<cf>employed.
You can speak with and enlist the pawns<cf>you encounter in town or out on the roads.
If your party is overloaded, speak with a<cf>storehouse keeper to deposit items and<cf>equipment.
Anything in storage can be retrieved from<cf>any storehouse in the world.
You can also send items to storage from any<cf>resting spot. Keep your inventory neat and<cf>organized, and avoid being weighed down.
If a pawn possesses the right knowledge<cf>and skills, they may be able to assist<cf>you in tandem attacks.
Press <TUTO><SIZE 28><ICON LIFT></SIZE> to grab on to -- and climb <cf>upon -- larger monsters, at some cost<cf>to your Stamina.
It's only here you can enable the skills<cf>and augments you learn. You cannot change<cf>them out in the field.
Core skills are enabled as soon as they<cf>are learned.
Check the Options menu to toggle whether<cf>or not your mini-map rotates as you turn.
Your main pawn will earn rift crystals<cf>while online in other worlds. Encourage<cf>other players to enlist your minion!
People who bear an icon above their head<cf>possess special information.
Those bearing green icons have new quests<cf>to offer.
People with red icons appearing over their<cf>heads have information relevant to your<cf>priority quest.
Sit at this special chair to mentor your<cf>main pawn.
For certain powerful magicks, incanting<cf>the same spell as a pawn will shorten the<cf>time required to cast it.
Downloadable content includes extra<cf>weapons, armor and more.
Some downloadable content can make your<cf>journey easier.
If you come upon a pawn equipped with<cf>strange or unfamiliar equipment, it<cf>could be downloadable content.
You can purchase downloadable content<cf>from the <NS>.
Don't forget to enable skills and augments<cf>for your main pawn as well.
Performing actions that people dislike will<cf>decrease their affinity for you.
A Ferrystone will spirit you back to Gran<cf>Soren in an instant, no matter where you<cf>are located.
It is by far the fastest and safest method<cf>of travel, but each stone disappears after<cf>a single use.

What? Who the hell are you?
Piss off!
Am I supposed to care you're "Arisen" or summat?
You're not wanted, get it?
Wanna find out what we do to tresspassers?
I was just thinking about dealing someone bodily harm. Shall I start with you?
Bugger off!
You're as brazen a fool as any I've seen.
Don't you ever leave?
No one's killed you yet?
How goes it?
Hey!
Those pig-swiving, pox-stricken strumpets!
What're we to do about it?
Oho?
It's well past time to collect on these debts.
Now, what is the best way to make them bleed?
There's an idea!
Eh?
Ahh...exactly.
Then what?
Hoy, there... Quite the pretty little item you have there, friend.
Why not leave it with me a while? I'll craft you a forgery fit to fool the Maker's own eye.
I'll have the goods ready by this time tomorrow. Call again then, will you?
Not quite done yet, I fear. Pray, give me a while longer.
Here we are. A perfect duplicate. 'Tis yours.
The other will take a trice yet. Patience, friend!
Right, leave it to me.
Taking it with you, eh? Here, then.

Gives me chills just to think of it... Ah! Er, I was-- I didn't...!
I'll make no excuse, cousin. I hid in the well for fear of the dragon...
And let me tell you this: you'd be wise to keep your distance from that pit!
I was too craven to venture far, and lucky thing... A queer growl echoed back with the sound of water from further in.
There's aught down there, mark my words. I could feel it,<cf>I could...
You'll not see me going back down there to find out what!
Investigate the well
Not now
What? You...mean to go down there!? ...You're a right hero!
Here. If you're set on going, take this with you. It should have some use to it left.
I'll not soon forget your bravery, cousin. Pray, just come<cf>back alive!
Aye, 'tis a rank fool who rushes into danger of his own will.
The more I think back on it, the tighter terror grips me... That growl was a monster's, I've no doubt.
Mayhap one of the other men of the village will be willing to brave the danger.
Investigate the well
Not now
What? There are monsters in the well for true? ...Already slain!? Cousin, you are a wonder!
Oh, this is a blessed relief... I'd feared the others might make me go myself.
I'd have died of fright afore I found the first beast! Here, take this, cousin. 'Tis small thanks for having saved my life.
I shall strive to learn from your example -- commit myself to becoming a soldier fit to defend the land and its people. ...Honest!
You've slain the monsters of the well, have you? Truly, you are a wonder, cousin!
Now I think upon it, 'twas my hiding in the well what brought the danger to light... I take no credit, mind!
I simply feared I'd be blamed for releasing monsters upon the village for having opened up the well.
'Tis a relief, and all your doing, cos. Here. I owe you at least this much for all you've done.
I shall strive to learn from your example -- commit myself<cf>to becoming a soldier fit to defend the land and its people.<cf>...Honest!
Some refuge I chose, eh? 'Tis almost a blessing I was blind<cf>with fright.
I heard a low growl while I was down there. Had I seen<cf>further back...
'Tis too frightful to think on.
A queer mix of hissing and the burble of water comes from within.
What? In our well, here!?
You'll not just let them be, surely!? Go, fisher! Be rid of them!
Not a one of us is safe while monsters lurk beneath our village! Get in that well and slay them all!
The caves at the well's base run deeper than you might think.
I know from the echo what returned my screams and whimpers...
I've not given over to the rot that Salvation is peddling, mind.
But it's madness plain and simple to imagine this pile of stones will halt the dragon.
I'll not trade my life for such folly.
You are blind to the truth, Arisen!
Perdition is nigh! The hour of redemption is upon us!
All will burn, and through fire return to nothingness!
In the name of Salvation, the world must know chaos. The world must know destruction!
Goblin!
A goblin pack!
Careful! A goblin!
They show too much order for goblins.
A goblin, but...what's it doing?
The goblin has a shield!
Knock it to the ground,<cf>and its shield is useless.
A fallen goblin is an easy mark.
Goblins hate fire.
Goblins ill like fire!
That goblin bears a horn.
That horn will draw more of its kind!
Kill the horn-blower first,<cf>ere it calls for help!
Their kind hates ice and fire both!
Goblins are weak to ice's bite.
Ice serves well against goblins!
Prepare yourself, goblin!
The goblin falls! Strike, now!
I'll strike the fallen!
I'll crush its head!
A goblin's head is vulnerable!
Strike its weakpoint...the head!
I'll shoot the head!
That goblin carries something...
What's it plotting? ...Stay ready.
What is that? A horn?
That one...wears a helm?
The one with a helm must be chieftain.
The goblin in the helm is their chief!
The quickest among them is the leader!
Take aim for their chieftain!<cf>There, with the helm!
Do not allow it to blow that horn!
A horn -- they call for aid!
It resembles a goblin...
'Tis large, for a goblin...
Goblin kin, perhaps?
A hobgoblin, Arisen! Be wary!
A band of hobgoblins is nearby...
Hobgoblins...just look at them.<cf>What say we crash their party?
The hobgoblin sleeps...
It seems to be asleep.
They're lost in their revels.
Their kind is weak to fire.
Ice is effective.
Fire and ice both<cf>are bane to hobgoblins.
Hobgoblins are weak against the cold.
It has a horn.
That one holds a strange horn...
Careful! It readies Dragon's Spit!
Stand clear! It's got Dragon's Spit!
'Tis oil...! Stand back!
Careful! It means to coat us in oil!
Strike the lot of them down at once!
The hobgoblin falls!
Grimgoblin, Arisen!
You must strike hard to make a<cf>grimgoblin flinch.
We're surrounded by grimgoblins!
Beware -- its blade is deadly!
It's weak against fire,<cf>same as its cousins.
Grimgoblins are weak to the cold.
Fire and ice both are bane to<cf>grimgoblins.
It bears a shield!
It calls more grimgoblins with<cf>that horn.
Mind the Slumberstones it tosses!
It's fallen!
It readies a Slumberstone!
Careful! It attacks again!
The one casting stones -- end him!
Let's be rid of the stone-thrower first!
Mind the stones it throws!
I'll rid us of the stone-thrower!
I'll put an end to that stone-caster.
'Tis no normal goblin!
It strikes far harder than its cousins!
'Tis far stronger than a common<cf>goblin!
Mind its saber's edge!
They're a threat when well unified.
Silence the horn-blower!
Watch they don't blind you!
Ignore the goblins! Strike at the hob!
Hobgoblin! 'Tis a formidable foe.
So many...!
'Tis goblin territory, this.
Stand firm. They descend upon<cf>the fallen.
Do not let their size deceive you!
It threw a flask!
The one barking orders must be the<cf>leader.
Those shields are a bother...
That torchlight is not the work of<cf>humans...
Looks as though they follow the large<cf>one!
Some species of goblin are<cf>bloodthirsty.
A black goblin...?<cf>I've ne'er seen its like...
Seems even the monsters have<cf>changed...
The jars they throw are charged<cf>with lightning!
Gird yourself against lightning.
Careful! They fall upon wounded<cf>prey as one.
A goblin of uncommon size, Arisen!
Is... that a goblin?
Greater goblin!
A greater goblin comes!
A pack of greater goblins!
Thunder is bane to greater goblins!
They far outstrip other goblins in size<cf>and strength both!
That goblin bears a staff...
A goblin shaman!
Arisen! A goblin shaman!
A pack of goblin shamans!
Magick ill serves against goblin shamans!
It seems that goblin wields magick!
Beware the shaman's magick!
Where... What have I...
Your Grace... Edmun, I...
This isn't...
This wicked fool mistook a trifling kindness<cf>that I once paid for something more...
He stole into my room. I was terrified!
She stole into my room. I was terrified!
This commoner must be made to learn, sire!
This commoner must be made to learn, sire!
Give him a taste of the lash and a<cf>stay in the dungeon!
Give her a taste of the lash and a<cf>stay in the dungeon!
Feste... Feste! I know you're there!
Milady is mistaken!
I would never violate His Grace's privacy<cf>while he violates milady's privates.
I'll brook none of your japes, fool!<cf>Summon the guards!
Have this villain removed!
I heard of Fournival's inquest. Serves the lout right, says I.
I'll sign any petition you set before me if it means he'll hang for what he's done.
He deserves no better after what he did to my family!
It's in your hands now, cos.
See that petition serves as old Fournival's ticket straight to hell.
'Twould be a simple task for an army of a hundred... Ah, well.
What are you doing!? Fight!
Stand firm!
Aaaaugh!
Have you aspirations, ser?
I never learned the meaning that word holds, and now...
What is that abomination...?
A goat's head, from the shoulders<cf>of a lion...? With a serpent tail?
With so many heads, it has no blind<cf>spot.
How does one face such a beast...?
A chimera, Arisen!
Chimera!
Watch for the goat's magick!
Stay away from the lion -- its<cf>claws are sharp!
Beware -- the snake spits venom!
Slay the lion to cripple its<cf>physical attacks!
Let's take one head at a time.
Slaying the goat will seal the<cf>beast's magick.
Its behavior changes with each head<cf>lost.
Destroy the lion's head and the<cf>beast becomes timid.
Defeating the goat's head makes a<cf>chimera wild.
The lion fears magick.
The goat is weak to physical attacks!
Attack the goat's head!
Be gone, abomination!
Don't let fear keep you back!
Let's be rid of that serpent!
Die, snake!
Accursed serpent...
Magick will still the lion's head!
I'll attack the lion's head!
The goat's head is mine!
The serpent is a threat, even now!
The snake can be cleft from the body!
We must seal the goat's magick!
It reels! Now, attack!
The beast is panicked!
I'll sear the wound shut!
The snake is done!
The lion is fallen!
I'll deflect its attack!
The goat is silenced!
Chimera!
A pride of chimeras!
There, Master! Chimeras!
A chimera, there!
Gorechimera!
A pride of gorechimeras!
There, Master! Gorechimeras!
There! A gorechimera!
I'll still the serpent!
Focus on one head at a time!
Stay clear of the serpent's poison mist!
Let's be rid of the serpent first!
Strike when the beast panics.
Ice'll serve against that chimera!
It can sprout a severed tail anew!
The serpent spits a burning poison!
The goat casts spells of death!
Slay the goat ere it heals the body!
There's talk of black chimeras,<cf>fiercer still.
A gorechimera!? We've no choice...
Rrgh, it attacks from every quarter!
I fear to think what those claws<cf>could do...
Twould be far simpler with<cf>one head fewer!
What!? 'Tis confused from our attack!
I see animal tracks, Arisen... Large ones.
A single beast with...three heads!?
'Tis a chimera... The first I've seen!
The tail's regrown!?
The goat wields curative magick!
A black chimera! This won't be easy...
I'll hold the serpent still!
Hit the lion with magick while<cf>it's stopped!
I'll mount the beast and hobble it!
The goat's bleating can lull a man<cf>to slumber.

You've come!
I came here to the abbey in hopes they might find me worthy to send on to the Grand Cathedral in Auldring...
No place holds so much wisdom concerning the dragon as there.
While I am here, I train as a sister of the Faith. I'm to gather flowers.
They say I've talent as a healer. That if I labor hard enough, I...
They say I'll learn to grant blessings upon others through flowers.
I fear I am a poor judge of such things... Still, what say you, cousin?
Accept the flower
Do not accept
'Tis said a blessing of flowers leaves the recipient awash with joyous feeling. ...Any luck?
Though, in truth, 'tis the Mother Superior here I must convince of my abilities, and the priests.
I must show them I've an aptitude as a healer.
But, as I said before, I've little notion what to expect...
Could I ask you to give a flower to someone and tell me of their response?
I thought not...
You never were one for flowers, cos.
Still, my offer stands. Come and tell me if you change your mind. I would welcome the help in my training.
What say you, cos? Fancy a blessing of flowers?
I would ask you aid in my training by giving this to someone for me.
Accept the flower
Do not accept
Give that flower to someone afore it wilts, won't you, cos?
I've prayed over it hard enough to give even the Mother Superior a start.
I only hope the blessing reaches the recipient...
You delivered the flower? And what did the father say?
Then they acknowledge my skill as a healer!
I knew I was right to have come here.
If I continue at this pace, I am sure to earn transfer to the Great Cathedral. I swear I will!
Then I shall learn more of the dragon to aid in your journey!
I knew I was right to have come here.
If I continue at this pace, I am sure to earn transfer to the Great Cathedral. I swear I will!
Then I shall learn more of the dragon to aid in your journey!
I'll continue my work with the flowers. Come see me anytime, cos.
What, you would give it back to me!?
Thank you, but...'tis no help to my training, cos.
My happiness getting flowers from you has naught to do with blessings.
You've seen the flower delivered, then? Thank you, cos.
I knew I was right to ask you.
You...lost it?
Forgive me, cos. I've no spare to offer. They take some time.
It grieves me to report an item was stolen from the castle's stores a few days past.
It was a possession of the duke's, and a treasure of the realm: the Wyrmking's Ring.
The band was stolen under heavy watch... I fear it to be the work of someone within the castle.
But first, the ring must be reclaimed. Will you do it, ser?
Accept
Not now
You would do well to begin by asking the men and women of the castle what they know.
That ring is a treasure to all Gransys, and a symbol of the duke's authority. It must be found.
Do not dismiss this as a simple theft, ser. The duke's authority is at stake.
It must be resolved with all haste. Pray, make your preparations, then see it done.
Well? Setting this matter to rights will go far in proving your worth to the duke, ser.
Will you reclaim the Wyrmking's Ring?
Accept
Not now
This theft is fast becoming the talk of the castle. Best you go and hear what is being said.
It pains me to suspect my peers, but now the unthinkable has happened, we must consider every possible explanation.
Salomet... 'Tis a name that calls up bitter memories.
Time was, the duke held a council of magick scholars here in Gran Soren, tasked with ensorceling grimoires and trinkets.
Salomet sat at the head of the council. His genius was unmatched...save by his ambitions.
Once their research bore fruit, Salomet betrayed His Grace and fled with the findings.
He disappeared, leaving the corpses of his fellow scholars in his wake.
I know not by what design he would reveal himself now... Perhaps aught about this ring that compels him.
If Salomet is our thief for true, no man can say what evil he means to work with that ring...
Whatever his plans, they must be foiled aforehand. He must be stopped.
The ring is reclaimed! I haven't the words to express my esteem, ser.
...A talisman of such power must be kept from those who would use it for ill purpose.
The duke will see it well guarded, and the faults in the castle's security mended.
Pray, let this lead us all to take greater care in the future. For now, you have my thanks.
You fought him, then? ...I knew 'twas his doing.
'Tis a shame he slipped the noose, but we cannot allow him to run free.
We must see him stopped, and the ring returned afore he can work more evil.
Salomet is here in Gransys yet. That much is certain...
Seek out travelers, peddlers... Anyone walking the roads. Someone will have seen him.
We must find him, and we must have that ring back.
Ah, a traveler? Welcome, child.
We have little to offer in the way of aid, but I hope you find your visit pleasant nonetheless.
May the Maker guide you.
I understand now. You are Arisen, in the flesh.
Since ancient times, the doors of the Faith have been open to Arisen as they go about their work.
I know not if we can aid your quest, but we shall try with all our strength.
The dragon is evil turned scale and bone. None can rest until it is defeated.
Truly, pay it no further mind, ser.
Quina's fierce resolve is a welcome spur to examine our own faith with fresh eyes.
A heart kept pure and faithful need never fear, no matter the state of the world around us.
Do you miss her, ser?
Quina will make a fine novice to the Faith. I ask only that you keep her in your prayers.
Since ancient times, the doors of the Faith have been open to Arisen as they go about their work.
I know not if we can aid your quest, but we shall try with all our strength.
The dragon is evil turned scale and bone. None can rest until it is defeated.
We shall pray for your safe passage, Arisen.
There is an evil force afoot in this land; I feel its potency grow by the day.
The dragon has awoken, and its might has never been greater!
The evil I sensed before stirs no longer.
Our long nights of prayer have been answered. You are truly Maker-sent, Arisen!
I...I don't understand... The dragon is defeated, its threat long passed... What new evil is this?
All my life, I have trusted in prayer to hold us stalwart against evil. But now, for the first time in remembering, I find myself...afraid...
Hmm? 
Seeking treasure, are you?
I'd abandon such thoughts. If there were spoils to be had, I'd have claimed them long since.
Force alone will topple them.
Brute force will fell this one!
This scarecrow's weak to blows!
We can fell this scarecrow by hand!
Raw power ought to serve!
I'll fell it with a spell!
Magick will end this one!
This scarecrow's weak to magick!
We can take this scarecrow with a spell!
Ruuun!
Why...?
The zealot slipped past, but at least we snared this one.
An humbler prize, sure, but at least he's talkative.
No honor among thieves, eh?
Eh heh... 'Twas just a lark... All in good fun.
I never gave over to that rot about<cf>destruction and salvation, never!
Just the same, he'd be trouble if we let him go free,
now that he's seen the two of us together.
Wait, you-- You promised me!
He's all yours.
Roots? At such a depth?
Does someone live here?
The moonlight lends this place an<cf>otherworldly feel.
Be cautious rounding corners.
Let's have a look about for anything<cf>useful.
A storehouse of some sort, perhaps?
The deeper we go, the keener I sense a...<cf>malice, or summat like it.
It seems this place is host only to those<cf>with some tie to the wyrm.
Huh. Curious place to find a path...
Seems we can pass through here.
A path, Arisen. Over here.

I am he who slips the earthly bonds.
We are the Nameless Men.
Your life belongs to us.
Huagh!
Whargh!
Eeeeagh!
Yoh!
Shaeha!
You seem well, fisher knight.
I bid you smooth sailing.
Quite right, quite right!
Nay, you've run aground, ser!
Oh, bliss! Oh, rapture!
My, my! 'Tis too great an honor for one of my stature!
How did you fare, fisher knight?
See you don't rest on your oars, friend. The work has just begun!
Ah! The glorious return of the inimitable, the indomitable, the unforgettable...
Scratch that last one. Who were you again?
I jest, fisher knight, for I am a jester.
I daresay every man in Gran Soren knows who you are by now.
Your fame is little wonder, at the fearsome rate you've solved the duchy's woes.
The Arisen nods, they say, and lo the spheres do shake!
And now His Grace has you in his direct employ?
Your rise to glory is an inspiration, humble knight, and no man looks up to you so much as I.
Ah, the mighty Arisen returns. Come, bend low and lend me your ear.
Tell me, good fellow, can you keep a secret?
Because I cannot, to save my soul.
And so I must confess to you that His Grace the duke was once himself an Arisen.
Ah, so you knew? I see, I see.
Tell me, then...
If you, by some truly inconceivable miracle, were to replicate his feat and slay the wyrm...
What then?
I fear you would find the duke less than pleased, to say the least.
He rules the land from atop the corpse of the beast he slew, and two heroes is one too many.
My, my! 'Tis too great an honor for one of my stature!
Best prepare well before we begin.
'Tis saurians were heard in the well.
Is it safe to leave saurians in the well?
'Tis a shock to see such creatures down here.
I'd not thought to find saurians here.
Monsters yet live in the well...
The deed is done.
This time, let us put an end to the saurians.
The creatures are slain.<cf>We should tell the others.
We'll certainly make use of that lantern here.
I hear cries from within...
Let's have that lantern lit.<cf>Take care it stays dry, Arisen.
I ill like the sound of that...<cf>Monsters, no mistake.
Strange shadows, all around us... Stay ready, Arisen!
Mind your head.
There's a way up here.
Watch your footing!
Watch your footing here.
Twas a fight to remember!
This leads behind the encampment.
Keep the lantern dry!
Not that way.
Oh.
Nngh!
Ngh...uuh...
Yoh!
Hooh!
<SHOP>You look well, child.
Take care, minnow.
Aye.
No, child.
Mm, I thank you.
Such a kind child. Thank you.
Hmph. Up to your old mischief, minnow? If you've time to gad about, make yourself useful.
We well knew the dragon was coming.
The Faith can keep their prophecies. The dragon always comes around, sure as the seasons.
I've seen it with my own eyes, I have.
I was in the bloom of my womanhood when the last dragon came<cf>to Gransys.
The duke slayed the last wyrm what came near.
I suppose that makes him of an age with me.
You don't get as old as me and Edmun for being a fool, I'll warrant you that.
You could stand to learn a thing or two, minnow. Come by again and I'll tell you a tale.
Up to more trouble, minnow?
The young folk of the village are all half-mad with worry, but there's time, yet.
When the dragon comes, it don't just set to burning the countryside straight off.
It sleeps, and gathers its strength. Where, or for how long, who can say?
The dragon's lethargy means there's time yet to rouse an army and strike the beast where it sleeps.
...Though the talk come from the encampment paints that lot as a right band of fools.
Back again, are you, minnow?
Here for more tales of the dragon, are you?
As I recall, the duke's dragon took to nesting in the far north.
Slept for weeks atop some cruel, barren mountaintop...
Duke Edmun set out to face his dragon where it lay. Mind you, that was before he was duke.
He rode as the Arisen then, and he stormed the mountain with his pawn allies in tow.
They say Edmun did battle with the wyrm for three days and three nights without rest.
Whether the dragon today is the same beast come again or aught else, I couldn't say...
But if it is the same, it may well be on that same peak now, gathering its strength.
Back for another of this old crone's tales?
Every soul in Gransys knows Duke Edmun Dragonsbane slew the wyrm, that's true.
But there's not a one of them who knows how the man did it.
The duke must have employed some dark art, no doubt, though his aims were noble.
But they say the man's never once told a soul about what happened up on that mountain.
Met with the duke, have you?
Hero or no, he must be a wizened old man by now. He's of an age with me, if not older.
Edmun'll be needing an heir soon I wager, though I wish the man health.
Stay your course and slay the wyrm and I'll be bowing to you as duke afore long, like as not.
That would be a sight to take to the grave, one of our little minnows grown to duke...
But a dead man can't sit a throne. See you don't throw your life away.
You're a brave soul, minnow, but death comes to us all in our time.
Don't hasten your own fate to spare us ours.
The dragon is a fearsome beast, but fickle, too.
I was raised on tales of dragons past, and of the destruction they wrought.
The cycle goes back long before my time. Further back than there were men in Gransys, might be.
Some dragons seared the land from the mountains to the shore, but others simply left.
When a storm takes you at sea, there's naught to do but pray it sees fit to spare you.
Even the finest seaman's at the mercy of the sea. Sink or float, it's providence.
Seems that dragons share the disposition of a storm...
Slain the dragon? You!? This'll be another of your japes, no doubt...
I'd swear your victory a lie, but for the fact the duke managed the same feat in his youth...
Perhaps, then, even a minnow such as you stands fair chance at felling the beast.
If you speak it true and the wyrm is dead, that's grand news indeed!
And to think such a champion should come from humble Cassardis!
In my eyes, you'll always be a minnow, tearing about and getting underfoot...
But with this, you've won the name of hero to all Gransys. You do us proud, child.
Hmph. Let those stone-headed fools in the capital talk as they will. You are a hero.
I've no doubt of that.
Back again, are you, minnow?
<SHOP>You look well, child.

Take care, minnow.
Mm, I thank you.

Such a kind child. Thank you.
Whoa, whoa, friend. Why am I here? You do as you like, but pray, leave me out of it.
Why not put an end to it? Praises of the quiet life are sung far too infrequent.
Hah hah, that's a might harsh, aye? Ever the noble one, you...
Strength of will? Aye, perhaps it is, by your reckoning at least...
Why this hesitation, ser? You've aught to protect, do you not?
This... This is your answer, then?
Th-the wyrm...

Ngh.
Ough!
Graaugh...
Hmh!
Rrragh!
Oy there.
Stay alive, eh?
Aye.
Naw.
Thanks.
I owe you one, friend.
Eager for a fight, are you?
You bastard!
Rragh!
I'll bleed you dry!
Augh, I'm done with you!
I'm damned sick of hearing people whinge.
Whole world's gone to hell...
Anh? What do you want?
Oy, piss off!
I'm sick of it all. The whole stinking lot...
I could use a bit of diversion 'round about now.
Do I look like the sort to care about the wyrm?
The Maker has a dark sense in jests, eh?
I owe you one, friend.
The dragon's roost, at last...
'Tis a place suffused with danger...
Come. No reason remains to stay our<cf>march.
Steady on, here. Slow and careful.
Let's press on.
I can feel the dragon... We're near.
The remains of a temple, perhaps?
This way to the dragon, Master.<cf>Let's finish this.
This aura... 'Tis the dragon, for certain.
Even dragons die... The hour is<cf>come, Arisen!
'Tis our valor, pit against the<cf>wyrm's evil...
We near our journey's end. The final<cf>station of our long struggle...
We cannot suffer the wyrm to work<cf>any further atrocities.
No... I fear the whole of the<cf>vanguard has been slaughtered.
More bodies... The wyrm must be<cf>made to settle this debt.
What is that abomination?! Be well<cf>careful, Master!
Retreat holds only death, Arisen!<cf>We must cleave a path onward!
'Twas the feet of countless pilgrims<cf>first beat down this road to the temple.
Are there no other survivors?
Monsters have made a shambles of<cf>this place...
Let's hasten to the dragon's roost.
I feel it close by, Arisen. Stay<cf>ever ready as we advance.
I sense another presence. A mighty<cf>beast, but...not the wyrm...
Our kind is ever ready to fight by<cf>the grace of your guidance, Arisen.
The door opens by standing on the<cf>panel.
Might that panel there bear a link<cf>to the door?
Here the rite will end, Master.
And with it our vigil.
Right this way.
Our goal is ahead.
Follow me, Arisen.
Watch your step.
How dark it's gotten!<cf>Have you a light source?
Come, Master!
Here's another path, Master.
This way!
I am sorry, Arisen.
You share in my troubles through no fault of your own.
Some part of me has long known I was, in truth, a pawn. I do not age, or die, as others.
And always I found making my own decisions...difficult.
Gran gifted me a portion of her very soul. It was a kindness I can never repay.
At first, I knew not how to use this gift.
But now I have met you...
My...pawnprint?
Can I truly live? Can I be...human?
My...own voice...
I would be with you.
Awareness dawns upon me.
I see how pawns turn human, and what it means to choose a mortal life.
Life does not exist without death. Such a simple truth, and yet long have I denied it.
This is the reason for all that you are, Arisen... The truth of it will come to you in time.
Please, Arisen... Say that I might stay in your village. Under your roof...
I want dearly for a place I can feel safe.
Gran... She remains there, still. Deep in the wood.
I pray she will continue to watch over me...

This pawn is but one of legion. We are as you humans, but we are not human.
We are free of the mortal coil that binds you. Death is a stranger to our kind.
In return, we relinquish free will. A pawn does not choose the course its life will take.
We turn to you to provide that will. To grant us a cause and to spur us to action.
We have come upon a beast, though it seems the creature has found other prey.
Fight, flee, or merely stand and watch... The choice is yours.
Pawns know naught of tactics. We can merely react.
If a threat approaches, we meet it in combat. If you wish us do otherwise, give the command.
Observe the enemy, craft your stratagem, then issue your orders.
Those pawns you see fit to hire will join you in your travels.
At present, I am but one. Soon, up to three of us may assist you.
The path ahead is long, and fraught with danger. Be mindful of your companions' jobs and levels.
The Arisen's strength lies in crafting a party well-suited to the task at hand, whatever it be.
By your guidance, we have arrived at the encampment. 
This pawn's role is complete. I will leave you for the<cf>present time.
If you wish to know more of the pawn legion, seek the answers here.
You will hear the voice of guidance. May it lead you ever true.
'Tis a chilling sight...
Watching the cadavers fall ever down the shaft... It sets this pawn's body to trembling.
...Do it!
Your head is a meager trophy.
The men of the fort may have use of you yet...
Even a she-goat's skin can warm a desperate man anights.
What?!
Is no slander beneath you?!
The duel is well and settled, Arisen.
Begone from my sight at once.

Quest conditions cleared.<cf>You've defeated the griffin!




Krgh.
Nngh!
Gwaaugh...
Huh!
Hrrnh!
Hmph...
Away, away...
Aye...
Nay!
...Oh?
Why do you do this?
The dragon approaches, his voice like the wind, I see him, I hear him, he comes! His mouth holds the fire and his eyes keep the smoke, while his wings beat like terrible drums!
I die? You die? We never shall die! To die one must first be alive! If never we lived, which never we did, why then there is no death to contrive!
The dead can't die! The dead can't live! The dead can only be dead. As we are not here and have passed out of time, its for others to die in our stead.
The death and destruction as wrought by the dragon is nothing that mortals need fear. The world is a lie, an illusion, says I, and something we needs not hold dear.
Illusion! Illusion! Lies and deceit! A ripple cast forth by a wave! This world is but smoke in the night from a fire, the people no more than its slaves!
You live, you say? You claim this true? Then I have a question for thee: What does it do to say one's alive if you cannot yet say what it mean?
Prove you are here! Prove you exist! Prove that I stand here in kind! You cannot prove thus because then I could claim to be sprung from your own addled mind! 
You name me mad? Oh no, I'm not mad! I'm the sanest man you'll ever see! This crisis, Arisen, springs from your hand, and thus you must make us all free.
Alive? Alive! Such talk of alive! It's all become rather a bore. You should, like the birds, or the beasts of the fields, take fret in such things nevermore.
Do you stand before me? Do you see me true? Or is this some terrible jape? The Maker can't save you if he isn't there, no matter how you bend and you scrape. 
You claim that you live just by thinking it so, but such thoughts are wicked and sad. To never consider that you might be false is a path trod by only the mad!
The dragon? What dragon? The one in the sky? The one whom you seek to defeat? You swore to this oath, and yet foolish it was, for our lives are but chaff from the wheat!
None can command you! None can enslave you! None must you swear to obey! Even the dragon cannot force such a deed once you learn all life is a play!
You need not go on. Your road is not set. You can all your duties forswear. The way of Arisen is different for each, yet by duty has your heart been ensnared.
You hope when you plunge your sword deep in the wyrm that it then goes the way of all flesh. But like a court jester the jape is on you once you learn that life then starts afresh!
I see through your eyes and look straight at your heart and find it's wrapped tightly in doubt. I cannot speak falsely, and this pleases me some, for it shows my words taken sprout.
Believe in your fear! Keep it deep in your heart! Clutch it close to your breast like a swain! Fear's all that is real in this world of pretend, despite what priests claim at the fane!
We arrive at the end! The death of the real! The end of the start of the lie! The scales from your eyes soon will fall away and you'll see what you cannot deny!
Beyond the rift? There is no beyond! It's hollow and empty and void! And when you set foot in that terrible place what faith you claim will be destroyed! 
Only mortals know death! Only mortals know life! And alas, you can none of these be. Pray fly, fair Arisen, fly fast to your rift, wherefore emptiness might set you free.
...Oh?

Hello.
See you again, then...
That's so.
You're wrong there...
Thank you.
Thank you...truly.
Augh, I am tired...
A fellow can't get decent sleep in these tents.
Cleft the serpent's head easy as a sheaf of rye...
You're some wonder, Arisen.
I never was the nimble sort...
All I've talent for is charging in headlong, swinging wildly.
That your habit as well?
I mislike the ones that dart about so quickly...
Still, we managed all right, aye?
Damn that griffin... Damn it!
They were all good men, all... Crushed like ants...!
Thank you...truly.
Mm, just about got my feet back under me, finally.
'Afore all else, I best attend to my tackle. It's lain unused for far too long.
Seems as though the land crawls with all manner of foul creatures of late...
Between the beasts and my own ill health, I've half a mind to stay indoors and pull tight the shutters. 
No man can hasten the tide, eh?
The world is gone mad, cousin.
All right, what next?
'Tis madness, pure and simple...
Mm, just about got my feet back under me, finally.

Help me! She's still alive!
Well met, Arisen.
I'll not waste time on rhetoric:
Defeat me, and take my place as keeper of this world.
You saw it awaiting you at the end of your descent.
Aye. The same world you've traveled to arrive at this place.
A world you may well now inherit.
It is a simple proposition.
No different than any you've faced.
You need only the will to claim what is offered you.
...The will to survive!
Choose? How am I to choose?
No matter my answer, the price is death.
A hollow choice... Who am I to stand as<cf>arbiter of two lives?
...Of two loves.
What would you have me do?
You brought me here. You...
If this be the will of the gods... The order<cf>of the world... Then damn the lot of them!
No matter my answer... A hollow choice... Who am I to...<cf>What would you... If this be the will of the gods...
I'll tear the whole of it asunder!
Stop! NOOOOOO!
In memory of Grette,
Silent-hearted, dragonforged.
With hair of gold and will of tempered steel.
You ransomed me from a village burnt to Ash--instilled life, and fight. Dearest mentor, I commend you now to rest eternal.
Your servant, bereft of master and memory,<cf>I keep now at my side.
She lives on, your mirror in soul and body both,<cf>and I will not lose her as we have lost you.
This I swear before your empty grave.
"You have been chosen."
So saying, the wyrm prised the heart from my breast.
I was made Arisen: known to the dragon, and bound to hunt it.
It is a fate I embrace. What use have I for a heart<cf>left hollow?
In a world without sweet Grette--my mentor, my<cf>mother, my beloved...
I live only to see the dragon that claimed her slain.
I will see its scaly hide stripped from bone by my<cf>hands ere I rest.
I fancied myself a strong man...
Strong enough to protect someone.<cf>Strong enough to love someone.
I longed to prove it. To myself, as much as any other.
Longed to show that I could give aught back, and<cf>not simply take.
And yet, in that moment, I chose to cast it all away.
Though I cursed the world, what was writ true in my soul was an<cf>apology, to you and our master who fostered a soul within you.
Still a child, I stood amid the ashes of my village.
Through the driving rains two figures came.
One, a woman of golden hair, extended me<cf>her hand, perhaps in pity.
Grette was the name she gave. A hunter of<cf>sorts, she said. Her quarry, the wyrm.
As she spoke, the woman at her side simply<cf>stood and watched me, wordless.
She was a pawn, come of a different world--<cf>the first I had seen.
Her air was strange, yet somehow alluring.
I chose to join them, this Arisen and her pawn. It<cf>seemed that, or stand forever in the ruins of a lost life.
They offered no words of invitation, yet<cf>neither did they turn me away as I followed.
As we traveled, I was taught to fight.
Grette was my mentor, my mother. She<cf>breathed new life into my parched soul.
Then came the day the huntress found her<cf>mark. She left to face the wyrm...
That day's parting proved final.
Her pawn returned, alone and scarce alive.
Gone was the bold and faithful myrmidon who had served<cf>as Grette's steel. Her empty eyes stared through me now.
And what of the wyrm? Had our mistress<cf>felled the beast and stayed calamity?
The pawn held no answers, her mind and<cf>soul as broken as her body.
Yet no more of the earth was swallowed up. No more was<cf>the sky stained black. It seemed the world had been ransomed.
Or left, at least, to fester in the custody of humankind.
I was left with a single hope. A single wish.
To bring back light to the deadened eyes of<cf>a masterless myrmidon.
She was a pawn, I knew it well. Not human.<cf>Not of this land. And what of it?
She bore Grette's mien. Her face. Will or nil,<cf>I soon found myself in love.
You've met him...
He was my master, though it was a hundred<cf>lifetimes past.
When he came to face the dragon, he was<cf>given a choice too hard, too cruel to make.
He could live with neither answer, and so he<cf>offered only a curse in reply. Those words<cf>saw him become the monster he is now.
In granting him the cursed form he chose,<cf>the wyrm had held to its bargain... and I<cf>was the price.
I was his pawn, and his beloved besides.
Please... You must free him.
Let your iron will be as a hammer to shatter<cf>the bonds of hate that keep him here.
And if freedom is beyond his reach, pray offer him<cf>at least a peaceful end...
Please, ser... I beg you to help him.
Let your will prove the stronger, and crush<cf>the bonds of enmity that hold him.
His soul has been a slave too long. Pray,<cf>bring his suff'ring to a merciful end...
No paths lead hence.
Repent the folly of ascribing meaning to the void.
Naught shall remain.
Fall, molder, and be gone.
Be cast into nothingness.
This strength... Is this the temper of your will?
You have seen the world for the meaningless<cf>cycle that it is, yet even still...
I have raged and wrought destruction.
With my every breath I cursed the eternal<cf>chain and all who would perpetuate it.
But more than this, I have waited...
Waited for one with a will to outmatch my<cf>own, that they may break the bonds that<cf>hold me here.
In hate's demise... freedom...
Unto all things, unity in destruction.
I have seen the scattering of countless<cf>myriad souls...
They gather and flow to become as the river<cf>of time, expanding to fill the firmament.
What a base and trifling creature is man...
Yet at once is he the master of this<cf>empyreal flow, grand as all the heavens.
I bid you, hone your spirit. Refine it.
I shall await you in the crucible of souls.
Naught shall remain.
I have raged and wrought destruction.
What a base and trifling creature is man...
I bid you, hone your spirit. Refine it.
Come now, master. 'Twould be no harm<cf>in helping Quina in her training.
Shall we show that flower to the Mother<cf>Superior?
A priest would be able to judge Quina's<cf>skill from the flower she gave us.
Quina warned us the flower would wilt<cf>ere long...
Let's show the flower to a priest and have<cf>him appraise Quina's skill.
To whom will you give Quina's flower?
Best we gift Quina's flower soon, master.
Even the loveliest flowers wilt in time,<cf>master.
The flower has begun to wilt, Arisen.<cf>It will not last much longer.
I fear Quina's flower will be fully<cf>wilted ere long.
I'm afraid Quina's flower has wilted,<cf>master.
The poor flower has died...
Let's take the blossom to a priest, then.
Quina will be eager to hear what the<cf>priest had to say.
Quina mentioned we're free to take<cf>flowers any time.
'Tis a grand thing to bring joy to others.
Let's bring a flower to a priest as well,<cf>that he might appraise Quina's skill.
'Tis a beautiful sentiment, expressing<cf>one's feelings through a flower...
The priest here could most like appraise<cf>Quina's flower.
I pray fortune smile upon Quina in her efforts.
The castle guard's badly short on men.
I'm fit to beg help from any fool knows one end of his sword from another.
We're lucky to have folk skilled as you working for His Grace.
Word from the Greatwall is grim.
It grieves me to abandon them, but we're spread too thin here as is to spare any men.
I don't envy His Grace this bind.
I hear the dragon cleft the Greatwall stone like so much straw.
If that's the truth of it, Gran Soren's walls will fare no better.
I suppose it was folly to ever have thought otherwise.

Maker be good, you've returned to us! Ser, the city is in crisis.
Pray, lend your hand in returning the peace! Now, enter! Make haste!
I shall seal the gate behind you until order is restored, ser. Go, and Maker be your shield!
Never try the duke's men, serpent!
D-do something!
Yes, fight, Arisen, as you ere have fought in coming here!
What is it that impels you? What force spurs you on?
What sustained your wanderings and led you here?
I ask you: What is it that makes you alive?
'Tis volition. Unbending will.
You are here because you willed it, Arisen. That alone has brought you here!
Let us continue, Arisen.
Show that you are more than an empty vessel, animated by forces unseen...
Show that the temper of your soul is strong enough to command far more than mere pawns...
Show that your will is fit to bind the fraying circle of this world and hold it fast...
Fight tooth and claw. Struggle now, and cling to life.
Show that living holds worth enough to fight for!
'Tis a simple choice, Arisen:
Step forward, or retreat.
Accept the quiet emptiness of a false peace. Of false life.
Do you think them an illusion, Arisen? Are you so certain?
Will you sever all ties with the world you have known to reach me?
Then fear has bested you as well...
So be it. Go, and seek your peace. Your guttering beacon in the churning dark.
And I shall await the coming of the next...

My chest is all aflutter...
This is terrible...
It pains me to be a burden...
I've not felt better in years. 'Tis thanks to you, goodfisher.
Benita was singing your praises as well.
I am alive, though it was a near thing... My thanks.
Papers, please.
If you haven't anyone to vouch for you, I can't let you through. What sort of guard do you think I am?
I'm trying to work here. Move along.
Come no further, ser. Pray, go and pay your respects to His Grace.
So, the celebrated Arisen is come. You look able enough.
But I've no patience for pomp. I'm a man of substance, you see.
I've a policy of speaking only with folks possessed of their own will. Individuals, like.
We've our own ways of testing the strength of a fellow's will here, if you've the stomach for it.
Hear him out
Ignore him
There's naught can prove a man's will but his actions.
'Tis actions brings a band like mine together. Results. If you would walk among us, you'll adopt the same philosophy.
Which is to say you'll do as you're told. So listen well:
You've two paths before you. The first is to quash the competition.
To the northwest lies a rival band of thieves. See a few of their numbers laid to rest, permanently.
The second is to rid us of a traitor.
There is one who broke his oath and left this place without my leave. Find him and see that he reaps the consequences.
Make your choice, I care not which. Do one of these and I will know you for a person of will.
We shall talk of recompense then.
The band of thieves prowling the west are women, all.
Well beautiful, each in her way. A shame they haven't a scrap of principle among them.
They've no will of their own. Only instinct and greed, animals of avarice.
It grieves me to know the world thinks their ilk and mine no different.
The traitor who left our band is a man called Pike. He'll not have gone far...
He's young yet, still half an urchin. Want of company will have driven him to seek out some town to call home, no doubt.
If he'll not take ownership of his decisions in this life, you'll do him a kindness to end it.
As you like. 'Tis a show of will in its own right.
I well like folk who know their minds.
You recall the choice I laid before you, aye?
Thinning the competition, or silencing a traitor. 'Tis one, or the other.
Then the traitor is dead...
You've done well. The boy well knew the consequences of his actions.
'Tis swift and merciless justice what holds a band such as this together, besides.
I've no grudge against him, myself, but his will was second to the good of the whole, same as mine.
I must say, I am well surprised to see our traitor ails resolved so.
He is here. Pike has come back.
Our law has ever held death for oathbreakers.
Knowing that, he still came back. Said his life was ours to take in recompense for his betrayal.
He left us to thieve alone, then became some innkeep's pet when he failed even at that. He was a weakling, adrift on fortune's tide.
But now, after meeting you, he returned. He made his choice...proved the strength of his will.
I thought it only fitting to reward such growth, so I've decided to forgive his transgression for now... 'Tis a stay of execution.
Call me a softhearted fool if you will, but I feel well pleased by how the affair's resolved.
And you... You are quite something, to have instilled in the boy strength of will enough to overcome the shame of betrayal and fear of retribution.
A fine show of the temper your own will, Arisen. A fine show indeed...
You have proven your will, Arisen. In return, I grant you<cf>freedom.
You're an equal among us now.
The freedom to follow your own will where it takes you is a precious thing indeed.
Here, bring this whene'er you wish to pass. I shall see you are granted free transit.
You've hunted that skulk of vixens to the last, have you? I am glad to be rid of them.
You've quite the skill, Arisen. And the strength of will to match, I now see.
The Arisen is an interesting creature indeed.
You act on behalf of justice, even when it strays from the law... You are driven by more than the promise of profit...
I would be curious to follow your exploits, even were your actions not tied so to Gransys' fate.
We seek a merchant named Madeleine, Arisen. Have you seen her?
Yes
No
You have! And where did she off to?
The castle.
The countryside.
I don't know.
Damnation! She slipped the noose! Then we must double back to pick up her trail again...
You have my thanks, Arisen.
Hmm, I suspected she'd make for the countryside. We'll need form a hunting party...
You have my thanks, Arisen.
Damn. This search is but one grand jape...
You have my thanks, Arisen.
I feel it in the marrow of my bones... Some<cf>force beckons me beyond.
I will make for it, though my body fail along the way...

Ough!
Graaugh...
Hmh!
Rrragh!
Oy there.
Stay alive, eh?
Aye.
Naw.
Thanks.
I owe you one, friend.
...What?
Piss off.
If there's training to be done, we'd best<cf>do it.
'Tis always wise to hone one's skills.
That went poorly...
'Twas a task beyond our means...
'Tis a harsh challenge, that.
Let's report this result to Ser Berne.
Tis a regrettable result... Still, best<cf>we told Ser Berne.
'Twas a certain victory.
We've mastered combat at close quarters.
Ser Berne is a formidable warrior.
A man of his experience will not lose so<cf>easily.
We'll train, then try again.
We lack the experience, yet.
He'll not allow us to win every challenge.
Tis true the Arisen needs strength enough to slay<cf>any beast.
The Arisen's path is twofold: to hone the body,<cf>but also to temper the soul.
Worry not for his safety. We must give him all<cf>that we have!
Ser Berne will not afford us a moment's hesitation!
Twas an eye-opening experience... I should like<cf>another chance at it.
Honing our instincts here can only serve us in<cf>the field, Arisen.
We were bested... Let's look toward the next challenge,<cf>Master.
'Tis locked. You haven't the key to fit it...
'Tis caught on something. Perhaps it could open from the far side.
'Tis barred shut. Might be able to break the bolt.
'Tis shut tight.
'Tis no use at this hour. You'll have to come again later.
Best stop for now.
Seems they're closed.
Someone was here...
Lost them...
Gone...
Perhaps you've upset them.
There's naught to do here.
Best you moved on.
Not here...
The door is closed.
Shows no sign of opening.
There's aught there...
You don't see anything.
That smell...
Someone's near...
What's this...?
Fine view from here.
There's aught written here...
Must be a way to find something...
Smells delicious.
Perfect spot to place something.
You can almost reach...
There appears to be aught ahead.
That fall could kill.
'Tis dangerous to touch.
A strong blow might break it.
Perhaps if you came by night.
Perhaps if you came by day.
Perhaps if you came at dawn.
Perhaps if you came at dusk.
There's aught buried here...
You see no way up.
'Tis slick, this spot.
No use pressing any further.
No need to double back further.
No time for that now.
You cannot carry any more.
There may yet be aught lying about.
Seems there's naught you can take on at present.<cf>Best to try again later.
Perhaps with a bit of help...
Best you kept your weapon sheathed.
Is someone here...?
'Tis a place for tall folk.
'Tis a place for small folk.
Had you a woman in your band...
Had you a man in your band...
Had you a strong companion...
Had you a swift companion...
Had you a magick user...
Had you an apt climber...
Had you a skilled jumper...
This weapon will not help you.
That armor won't protect you.
You're ill equipped for this.
Seems it can't be used now.
You'll get no further use from it.
'Tis useless, now.
Hmm, not with your current equipment...
Not with your current party...
You hear aught from further in.
Enemies... They're close.
Best you got some rest.
You can carry no more!
You're too exhausted!
"Danger! Keep Out!"
"No Trespassing"
A sign.
Had you an Empty Flask, you might fill it here.
You'll get no further without a lantern.
'Tis dangerous to fumble about in the dark. Best find a light.
Best not just leave them.
If aught were left here, it would rot.
Best take care you don't get lost.
Best check the map.
You're due for a rest.
This place is dangerous by night.
This place is dangerous by day.
Breathtaking...
You'll get no further!
Seems you'll need to come back.
Nothing left here.
It looks fit to crumble.
Seems it could be moved...
It will not budge.
It will not open.
Seems you need a key.
Seems you need a Pickaxe here.
You yet lack the experience.
You yet lack the skill.
Not with your current vocation...
You'll not pass through this gate.
You've no time!
Seems you were too late.
You may make it, yet.
You're doing well for time.
Seems you've come at the wrong time.
There may be another path.
'Tis a powerful weapon... Too bad it doesn't work.
Something strong can be sensed from the stone. It <cf>appears the memories of someone have been etched<cf>upon the surface of the Monument of Remembrance.
To the Arisen, the one what brings free food and ale!
I can't say I'd have thrown a feast for the likes of you...but I'll not complain.
The duke hasn't held anything like this in too long! I was almost getting worried.
Move along, then, I'm out of small talk.
If you aren't offering libations I don't need to talk to you anymore.
Arisen! Arisen!
T-terrible news! The cap...capital...
Nngh...
Arisen! Pray, return to the capital with all haste!
I fear there's evil work afoot, ser!
Soren is... Gran Soren...
Arisen! Urgent word from the capital, ser!
You are to return to Aldous's side with all possible haste!
Arisen! Urgent word from the capital, ser!
You're to return at once! Pray, make haste!
Hold your ground!
We're lost... Run!
Damned...beast...
'Tis locked. You haven't the key to fit it...
'Tis caught on something. Perhaps it could open from the far side.

'Tis a powerful weapon... Too bad it doesn't work.
The Ur-Dragon is an incredibly powerful foe.<cf>Defeating it requires multiple encounters,<cf>chipping more of its health away each time.
When you're connected online, other<cf>players' progress will contribute to<cf>defeating the Ur-Dragon in your instance.
The reward you earn all depends on how<cf>much damage you dish out. If you're really<cf>lucky, you may even deliver the final blow!
A powerful, evil enemy lurks nearby.<cf>Beware engaging any pawns in battle, for<cf>they may be under its influence.
Wakestones are miraculous items that can<cf>bring your character, pawn allies, or <cf>others back to life.
Treasure each Wakestone, for the fragments<cf>required to form them are quite rare, and<cf>each stone can only be used once.
Gather enough Wakestone Shards and<cf>they will automatically assemble to<cf>form a complete stone.
A Ferrystone will spirit you back to Gran<cf>Soren in an instant, no matter where you<cf>are located.
It is by far the fastest and safest method<cf>of travel, but each stone disappears after<cf>a single use.
You can equip yourself with a primary and<cf>a secondary weapon.
Primary weapons such as swords and daggers<cf>are combat essentials. Secondary weapons<cf>like bows and shields offer support.
In addition to weapons and armor, you can<cf>also equip accoutrements with certain special<cf>abilities to give you an edge in battle.
Only one piece of jewelry and a single<cf>cloak can be equipped as accoutrements<cf>at any one time.
A heavy load will cause your Stamina to<cf>deplete more quickly. Sell or discard<cf>any and all items you no longer need.
Your lantern consumes oil. If it dims,<cf>use a Flask of Oil to refill it.
Some items can be combined with others to<cf>produce surprising results. Experiment and<cf>see what you come up with.

Don't let the rat escape!
That way! Quickly!
Give chase, men!
There! This way!
Spread out and search!
You'll not escape!
I can scarce believe it. Arisen...
You will pay for playing us for fools!
Death to the traitor!
This is the Arisen's doing?
I will have vengeance for my family!
Well met, Arisen. How may I aid you, ser?
You seek a wayward gardener? I fear I'll be little help for your cause.
Yet, hold a moment... We had cause to interrogate a castle laborer some days past...
Our spies learned of a plot wherein secrets of state were leaking to a gang of bandits. 
I believe the workman suspected of this sedition is in our custody still.
I fear that's as much as I know, ser. That I could aid you further...
Looking for me, friend?
Bearing good tidings, I hope? ...Else here to put me in chains, I'll wager.
No, it's Salvation brings you here. Aye?
I've had cause to ask the good folk of Gran Soren about Salvation myself.
Seems I'm cursed with a villain's mien, though. One look at my face stalls a man's tongue dead.
Had I your gentle manner, I'd have them singing long and loud, no doubt.
Seems to me we share a common goal. Perhaps you'd take on my investigation?
Accept
Decline
That's grand. Here, take this with you.
More's the pity...
You want them stopped, same as I, no? I've a nose for these things, you know...
But I'll not force your hand, friend. You know where to find me if you change your tune.
You're better odds at going 'round asking after Salvation than I...
The gentle folk of Gran Soren will sooner speak to the Arisen than the likes of me.
What say you, eh? Will you go hear what the people have to tell?
Accept
Decline
That token I gave is a countersign.
It will mark you as friend to agents of Salvation. Mayhap loosen their tongues as well.
I hope you'll return to share your findings, good Arisen.
A gathering in the crypts, is it?
There's more than one way into the catacombs. Nearest to here's northwest, across the river.
My thanks for the tip, friend. I'll be there to tend to a few matters myself.
Quite the sight, that was. Though I s'pose it's the stuff of every day to you, Arisen.
I'd thank you to join me a moment.
Rather too kind, aren't you, friend?
Sparing his life will win you no thanks. Least of all from him.
Aye, he'll be around to stay your tongue presently.
I'd hoped you might assist me further, but I fear you lack the stomach for my work, friend.
I'll not have your conscience 'round my neck for a noose. Our partnership ends here.
Tonight the fisher knight<cf>leaves the humble shores of home
for the heady depths of court.
Pray, let this token from humble Feste
garner favor with the leviathans within!
Tut, tut! No time for thanks, friend.<cf>The duke awaits!
Sail on, dear knight, sail on!
Pray, do not play a greater fool than I, ser. I do not welcome the competition. The duke awaits.
Place is fit to set the hairs on your neck to standing on end, eh? And with good reason.
I'd thought to enjoy a quiet nip of the ol' spirits here, away from prying eyes, aye?
But then a fearsome rumble came from further yon. Against my better judgment, I went and stole a look... 'Twas monsters, sure enough... A regular hive of 'em.
Can't let the likes of them loose on the village, I thought, so I stayed here to hold them back. Lucky thing I thought to sneak a drink...
I'm well glad to see you, truth be told. I fear the beasts are beyond the means of this old man. Will you go and clear them out, cousin?
Accept
Not now
Surely you would not leave this place to the beasts? 'Tis a question of time afore they leave the well to hunt.
I ask that you put them to the blade, for the village's sake. ...And that you keep my drinking secret, for mine.
Accept
Not now
Delay too long, and the beasts will be upon the village, cos.
Take what time you need, but no more.
You'll not see me stealing down wells again, mark my words. I've learned my lesson well.
'Tis a quiet spot, and pleasing cool if a bit damp. I'd thought it the perfect place for a quick nip...
But naught spoils a man's drink like monsters roaming about. Pray, put an end to the beasts.
My thanks, and good luck to you. Don't leave a one of them alive.
The path beyond is convolved, and dangerous. Here, cousin. Let this protect you.
Take care.
Mm? The beasts are slain, then? Joyful news!
I will sleep easier not having their like crawling about below the village.
Here, 'tis a small token of thanks. Take it, cos.
Now to find another spot to steal a quiet drink...
You'll not see me stealing down wells again, mark my words. I've learned my lesson well.
Hoy there!
Can anyone hear me? Pray, come and help!
Is no one there?
There's trouble down the well!
'Tis locked. You haven't the key to fit it...
'Tis caught on something. Perhaps it could open from the far side.
'Tis barred shut. Might be able to break the bolt.
'Tis shut tight.
'Tis no use at this hour. You'll have to come again later.
Best stop for now.
Seems they're closed.
Someone was here...
Lost them...
Gone...
Perhaps you've upset them.
There's naught to do here.
Best you moved on.
Not here...
The door is closed.
Shows no sign of opening.
There's aught there...
You don't see anything.
That smell...
Someone's near...
What's this...?
Fine view from here.
There's aught written here...
Must be a way to find something...
Smells delicious.
Perfect spot to place something.
You can almost reach...
There appears to be aught ahead.
That fall could kill.
'Tis dangerous to touch.
A strong blow might break it.

Restore the riftstone?<cf>Current rift crystals: <RIMS><cf>Rift crystal cost: <RIM2>

Yes
No
Something strong can be sensed from the stone. It <cf>appears the memories of someone have been etched<cf>upon the surface of the Monument of Remembrance.
Why... Why!?
The children! Save the children!
Lady Aelinore remains prisoner within<cf>the duke's manse.
I am relieved to see you again!
The duchess... No...
Leave the fighting to me.
Let us be quit of this place!
You tend to the duchess!
Hurry, master!
They'll be upon us soon! Make haste!
We'll move faster if we carry her!
No... There are too many!
'Tis half an army!
You'd best wear a disguise, Arisen.
The manse lies this way.<cf>Let us make haste.
This path leads on to the manse.
The manse lies north. All else will need<cf>await another time.
We've a long road to walk yet.<cf>Come, this way.
We'll reach the manse ere long.<cf>Come, Master.
We're arrived... Though I fear we'd be<cf>more burden than boon to you inside.
'Tis the duke's manse. I suspect you'll<cf>steal in most easily alone, Master.
I am joyed to see you safe, Master!<cf>Come, let us quit this place!
Master, you're safe! Come, let's away!
This bridge is well old... It will not bear<cf>many at once.
'Tis too old a bridge to bear us all.<cf>We'll go one by one. After you, Arisen.
What are you lookin' at?
Off with ye!
Lookin' to bleed, are ya?
Bugger off!
If you've no business here, move on.
Best mind what you do here.
What is it?
I've naught to say to you.
Come to join our little band?
'Ow's the road treating you, cousin?
Er, well met, ser... Pray, forgive me for the trouble I caused.
I've cast aside thieving, I have. Become an honest man, apprenticed to the innkeep...
I owe the man a debt. You as well, if it please you. You've shown me there's more to life than nursing an empty belly.
I like my life here well, to be sure, but... I need to end my past life properly.
I've a mind to see my old brothers. To leave the fold for good and all...though they'll not like to hear it.
I mustered what mettle I have and came back ready to die...and was pardoned!
Next I fail, my head will fly, make no mistake of that. ...But this is the path I chose for myself. I've no regrets.

We don't suffer trespassers.
Eager to die, friend?
Be off with you!
You're daft, friend.
Have you naught better to do?
Still here, are you?
How do you fare?
Hoy!
Those rotten...
'Tis a poor jest...
...Truly?
We ought to have finished them earlier.
We'll do for them, we will...
Aye, we will...
What?
I see...
And what then?
Where do these trees find sunlight,<cf>I wonder?
Watch out!
Mark your footing well!
Succumb to a pitfall and you'll pay dearly!
'Tis dangerous there, Arisen!

Unto all things, unity in destruction.

Pray, do not lend credence to that fox's lies. He is a man drunk on ambition.

But even that is but a preamble. Giving him cause to meet with the duke in private is as good as lending him your dagger to plunge into His Grace's breast.
Ser Daerio is determined to see Fedel's traitorous designs thwarted.

Give him the real letter
Give him the forged letter
Refuse
My thanks, ser.
You have chosen wisely, and so doing have spared the castle of the chaos this scheme would have wrought.
'Tis fortunate Fedel moves slowly, for a fox. It will like be some time afore he's crafted his next plot.
I am certain Ser Daerio will see you rewarded for your aid in this matter, Arisen.
I cannot promise what, or when, but know that the men of the Stone e'er pay their debts.
Until then, I take my leave...
So be it, then. 'Tis a grave shame.
Ser Daerio was sure you would hear sense. It would seem even his judgment is not free of error.
I'll not pursue the matter further. Not here, least.
I dearly hope this mistake does not bear you bitter fruit in time, ser.
Pray, take care...

Personal Best - <DDTM>
Truly, I cannot begin to thank you, cousin...
'Tis in the darkest times we need most come to one another's aid. You've shown me that.
I still draw breath, and for that I must be grateful...
Gi arma, quattro!?<cf>(What is happening!?)

Morus, se lu'a!?<cf>(Dead, already!?)
From the well? Aye, I've heard the noises.
You don't suppose there's monsters down below? ...Not truly?
Seems it leads into the earth, ser.
The path ends.
You've returned. To think that without the Arisen, Gran Soren would fall into chaos so quickly...
Anything you can do to help maintain the peace would be sorely appreciated.
I shall seal the gate behind you until order is restored, ser. Go, and Maker be your shield!
Do you know of the Elysion, ser?
I heard two of the castle guard talking over a flagon last night. They say he's dangerous.
That he's on about how the world is mad, so we ought to embrace the madness ourselves.
It certainly seems to me like he's taken his own words to heart.
Bugger off!
What are you lookin' at?
Off with ye!
Lookin' to bleed, are ye?
I've naught to say to you.
If you've no business here, move on.
Best mind what you do here.
What is it?
'Ow's the road treating you, cousin?
Come to join our little band?
Why are you here!?
Piss off!
Who d'you fancy you are?
You're not welcome here.
We don't suffer trespassers.
Eager to die, friend?
Be off with you!
You're daft, friend.
Have you naught better to do?
Still here, are you?
How do you fare?
Hoy!
Those rotten...
'Tis a poor jest...
...Truly?
We ought to have finished them earlier.
We'll do for them, we will...
Aye, we will...
What?
I see...
And what then?
Unh...
Guh...
Gugh...uuuh...
Huh!
Hmph!
Well met.
Pray, take care.
Yes.
No.
I thank you, ser.
'Tis an honor, and a pleasure.
I fear I am quite busy at the moment. If you've no pressing matter, I ask that you come again.
Ahh, the much celebrated Arisen.
I'd have well liked to see you slay the hydra at the encampment.
This place? Aye, 'tis Gransys' shield against the creatures of the north.
A place steeped in history, as you'll note from the scars and tatters.
I fear the men's morale is in about the same condition.
I'd have well liked to see you slay the hydra at the encampment.
The situation has changed, ser. You needn't trouble yourself further.
We are in your debt for procuring those supplies, ser.
I fear 'tis the fate of those off in the distant reaches of the land to oft be overlooked.
Hmm, we are plagued with ill fortune...
Our supply lines have faltered, leaving us without the means to train. Morale has fallen off, besides.
Mm? Are you come on His Grace's business, Arisen?
I fear I am quite busy at the moment. If you've no pressing matter, I ask that you come again.
Arisen. This is for you.
Mistake me not, I take no joy from standing idle. I would happily return to work, had we the supplies.
If anyone could make good use of this, 'tis you.
I must say, Arisen, you've an uncommon intellect, and a shrewd nature to match.
'Tis some manner of fate what caused our paths to intersect.
Pray, take this. A humble token of our fellowship.
'Tis an honor, and a pleasure.
I ask you--is that the fate you've chosen, of your<cf>own will?
You are Arisen.
We stand now on Bitterblack Isle, far asea<cf>from the cove we departed.
I would ask you to explore its depths.

To the Arisen! May the path ahead e'er be clear!
I cannot fathom His Grace's mind in this...
I've no stomach for such gatherings...
Let us speak another time, ser.
Pray, calm yourself.
If you're traveling around with pawns, why not pay the Pawn Guild a visit?
The lot of us guards won't hold the city an hour once the dragon shows.
Arisen, then, are you? Have you been by the inn?
The innkeeper was an Arisen in his own day. Gives a special rate to your kind, I hear.
We have urgent word from the Stone of the Southwest.
A horde of goblins struck the fortress while it was still under repair, and they've claimed it.
Though the hold is remote, its importance to our southern defenses is critical.
We must reclaim it, and soon.
The safety of the entire duchy rides on this matter. I would ask your help in resolving it.
Accept
Not now
You have my thanks, ser. I shall send word to the hold presently.
I've sent some of the duke's swords on ahead already. Meet them there and lend them your arm.
I await good word of your success.
If you've more pressing matters, I suppose there's naught for it...
Tend to what you must, then pray return to me with all haste.
Are you prepared to leave for the fortress? Pray, make haste, Arisen.
Those damnable goblins are good for a fair piece of trouble, no question, but we must have that hold back.
Ah, good Arisen. Word of your victory over the goblin horde precedes you, ser.
With the fort back in our hands, the south of Gransys is shielded once more.
You've quelled yet another of His Grace's worries. May your success continue, ser.
A shame the fortress could not be won back... 'Twas a failure in our preparations.
The men of the hold sent word of your efforts, though. You have roused them mightily.
Morale is a precious thing, as His Grace would like agree. Pray, take heart, ser.
Perhaps we ought begin with those<cf>who deal in such items?
I've heard there's an art forger in<cf>Gran Soren.
A hill bearing a drawing...<cf>'Tis hard to envision.
Seems there is a hill what bears the<cf>same mark as that slate.
So we seek a hill... But which one?
Let's make sure of our destination<cf>before we set out.
Hillfigure Knoll lies north of Gran<cf>Soren.
We'll head north.<cf>The hill should be there.
We'll know it by the ruins as we<cf>draw near.
Let us return to Gran Soren with this<cf>news.
Ser Maximilian awaits word of what<cf>we've learned.
A figure... That must be the place.
A man in the fields west of Gran<cf>Soren knows of the Dragonforged...
There was one who knew of the slate<cf>in the markets...
A Gran Soren courier knew aught of the abode of the Dragonforged.
Others may know more of Wyrmspeak.
No harm in asking more of the<cf>common folk.
Let's ask around about this slate.<cf>Someone may know of its meaning.
Perhaps The Black Cat's proprietor can<cf>read it... He forges such texts, after all.
Hillfigure Knoll... 'Tis an area I am<cf>ill familiar with.
'Tis a fair distance to Hillfigure<cf>Knoll. Let's prepare well.
We've finally arrived.
Best to proceed straight ahead,<cf>like as not.
This way!
Let us head north.
It must be near...
Said markers also appear on the mini-<cf>map, and on your full map besides.
Important locations, people, or<cf>objects will bear a quest marker.
Someone must know something about<cf>this matter. Let's ask around.
Not that way.
Let us check the map.
Hello.
Thank you.
I could hardly be happier.
I could hardly be happier.
Ah, the Arisen! Welcome!
It would seem our fates are closely bound.
The honeyed sleep of destruction<cf>will find this place...
And all the world, in its turn.
Indeed, the coming night ill needs us,
its faithful harbingers.
Just as you, in your hubris, cannot hope
to stop the divine beast that marked you.
Before its might you stand as useless and frail
as this ungainly contrivance of brick and mortar!
Nonetheless, the trice you might<cf>delay the dragon's coming
is blasphemy just the same.
I had brought my flock to see<cf>these walls reduced to dust,
but first they shall peel the flesh<cf>from your bones, my dear Arisen.
'Tis locked. You haven't the key to fit it...
'Tis caught on something. Perhaps it could open from the far side.
'Tis barred shut. Might be able to break the bolt.
'Tis shut tight.
'Tis no use at this hour. You'll have to come again later.
Best stop for now.
Seems they're closed.
Someone was here...
Lost them...
Gone...
Perhaps you've upset them.
There's naught to do here.
Best you moved on.
Not here...
The door is closed.
Shows no sign of opening.
There's aught there...
You don't see anything.
That smell...
Someone's near...
What's this...?
Fine view from here.
There's aught written here...
Must be a way to find something...
Smells delicious.
Perfect spot to place something.
You can almost reach...
There appears to be aught ahead.
That fall could kill.
'Tis dangerous to touch.
A strong blow might break it.
Perhaps if you came by night.
Perhaps if you came by day.
Perhaps if you came at dawn.
Perhaps if you came at dusk.
There's aught buried here...
You see no way up.
'Tis slick, this spot.
No use pressing any further.
No need to double back further.
No time for that now.
You cannot carry any more.
There may yet be aught lying about.
Seems there's naught you can take on at present.<cf>Best to try again later.
Perhaps with a bit of help...
Best you kept your weapon sheathed.
Is someone here...?
'Tis a place for tall folk.
'Tis a place for small folk.
Had you a woman in your band...
Had you a man in your band...
Had you a strong companion...
Had you a swift companion...
Had you a magick user...
Had you an apt climber...
Had you a skilled jumper...
This weapon will not help you.
That armor won't protect you.
You're ill equipped for this.
Seems it can't be used now.
You'll get no further use from it.
'Tis useless, now.
Hmm, not with your current equipment...
Not with your current party...
You hear aught from further in.
Enemies... They're close.
Best you got some rest.
You can carry no more!
You're too exhausted!
"Danger! Keep Out!"
"No Trespassing"
A sign.
Had you an Empty Flask, you might fill it here.
You'll get no further without a lantern.
'Tis dangerous to fumble about in the dark. Best find a light.
Best not just leave them.
If aught were left here, it would rot.
Best take care you don't get lost.
Best check the map.
You're due for a rest.
This place is dangerous by night.
This place is dangerous by day.
Breathtaking...
You'll get no further!
Seems you'll need to come back.
Nothing left here.
It looks fit to crumble.
Seems it could be moved...
It will not budge.
It will not open.
Seems you need a key.
Seems you need a Pickaxe here.
You yet lack the experience.
You yet lack the skill.
Not with your current vocation...
You'll not pass through this gate.
You've no time!
Seems you were too late.
You may make it, yet.
You're doing well for time.
Seems you've come at the wrong time.
There may be another path.
It won't open... Seems it's controlled by some<cf>device.
A mechanical platform...
'Tis shut tight. The door bears five small hollows...
Still shut... Seems you'll need all five jewels.
No matter how you fiddle with it, 'tis still broken.
The lock opens.
A Ferrystone will spirit you back to Gran<cf>Soren in an instant, no matter where you<cf>are located.
It is by far the fastest and safest method<cf>of travel, but each stone disappears after<cf>a single use.
You can equip yourself with a primary and<cf>a secondary weapon.
Primary weapons such as swords and daggers<cf>are combat essentials. Secondary weapons<cf>like bows and shields offer support.
In addition to weapons and armor, you can<cf>also equip accoutrements with certain special<cf>abilities to give you an edge in battle.
Only one piece of jewelry and a single<cf>cloak can be equipped as accoutrements<cf>at any one time.
A heavy load will cause your Stamina to<cf>deplete more quickly. Sell or discard<cf>any and all items you no longer need.
Your lantern consumes oil. If it dims,<cf>use a Flask of Oil to refill it.
Some items can be combined with others to<cf>produce surprising results. Experiment and<cf>see what you come up with. 
Place waypoint markers on your map to<cf>keep track of your progress.
If you've forgotten where you are in the story,<cf>select "Chronicle" from the Pause Menu to<cf>review a history of your journey thus far.
Select "Options" from the Pause Menu to<cf>customize your mini-map and status display.
The higher the fall, the more damage you<cf>will suffer.
Note that you move somewhat slower while<cf>your weapon is drawn.
Exhausting all Stamina will make you unable<cf>to act for a time. Take care to conserve<cf>energy!
You can attack while clinging to foes.
Petrifaction cannot be cured by normal<cf>magick, and is fatal if left untreated.
Use Secret Softener or the like to<cf>cure any petrified allies.
Your rank within a vocation rises as you<cf>defeat foes and complete quests. At higher<cf>ranks, a broader variety of skills are available.
Defeating foes and completing quests earns<cf>you more discipline, boosting your prowess<cf>in a vocation.
Pawns will collect and use items of their<cf>own volition.
You cannot carry or purchase items that<cf>would cause you to exceed your maximum<cf>encumbrance.
Press <TUTO><SIZE 25><ICON TOUCH></SIZE> while climbing down a ladder<cf>to descend quickly. 
If a pawn remains unconscious for too long,<cf>they will be forfeit.
Your support pawn has become forfeit, and<cf>returned to the realm whence they came.
Your main pawn has become forfeit,<cf>disappearing and returning to the rift.
You cannot join covenants with other pawns<cf>while your main pawn is forfeit.
Touch any riftstone to return your lost<cf>main pawn to your side.
If a support pawn is forfeit, any items<cf>they were carrying are sent to item storage.
You can send off departing pawns with a<cf>single item as a gift for their creator.
You can pass items to and from your pawns<cf>on the sub menu.
I will have vengeance for my family!
"History tells the hexer of Witchwood read the Wyrmspeak letters for the village, long ago.
"One familiar with the dragon's tongue might ken how to cleanse a wound from the beast.
"I make for the forest to find the witch and beg her aid. I will return with all speed. --Quina"
I feel watching eyes, Arisen...
Focus on naught but combat now!
Augh, 'tis shut fast!
Rrgh, it will not open!
We've no time for distractions now!
The door will wait. Our opponent seems less<cf>patient!
We can pass through here!
The door is unbarred! Quickly!
Retreat!
This way! Quickly!
Hurry! Through this passage!

Off with ye!
Lookin' to bleed, are ye?
Bugger off!
What are you lookin' at?
Best mind what you do here.
What is it?

Those rotten...
'Tis a poor jest...
...Truly?
We ought to have finished them earlier.
We'll do for them, we will...
Aye, we will...
What?
I see...
And what then?
"You have been chosen."
So saying, the wyrm prised the heart from my breast.
I was made Arisen: known to the dragon, and bound to hunt it.
It is a fate I embrace. What use have I for a heart<cf>left hollow?
In a world without sweet Grette--my mentor, my<cf>mother, my beloved...
I live only to see the dragon that claimed her slain.
I will see its scaly hide stripped from bone by my<cf>hands ere I rest.
...Arisen. Bearer of the dragon's mark. Undying<cf>corpse, enjoined to make your will manifest.
If my voice reaches you, heed me well.
The Arisen, the Seneschal, the whole cursed world...<cf>All is but an illusion.
A meaningless refrain. A hollow echo... What sense<cf>is there in giving one's life for these falsehoods?
I damn them all.
And I will not cease in my destruction until the last<cf>senseless cycle is broken, the last bond rent to<cf>dust.
I feel it in the marrow of my bones... Some<cf>force beckons me beyond.
I will make for it, though my body fail along the way...
What errand could demand an audience so<cf>late?
What could Lady Aelinore require of you<cf>at such an hour?
I shall await your safe return, master.
I shall await you here.
Night is come. I feel as there was aught<cf>we were to do this eve...
Nightfall, Master. Mirabelle awaits you<cf>within the castle.
'Tis locked. You haven't the key to fit it...
'Tis caught on something. Perhaps it could open from the far side.
'Tis barred shut. Might be able to break the bolt.

Uh!
Guh!
Wauuugh...
Hmph!
Hraah!
Road treating you well?
Let us meet again soon.
That is so.
No, no.
You have my thanks.
I shall not forget this kindness.
The dragon's come? And here I'd thought the streets were bare...
I suppose the loss of patrons is the least of it, eh?
I ran afoul of the dragon once before, back when I worked a city in the mainland.
That was a sad sight...
City folk fleeing in terror, trampling down their own. Others killed by beasts...
Losing your head to fear will kill you sure as losing your head to steel, make no mistake.
I ever mention I crossed paths with a dragon once before, back in Auldring?
It came and sent the land into a right terror, sure...
Then the damned beast vanished. Just up and left, without so much as one singed brick.
Queer beasts, dragons...
You suppose that dragon in Auldring years back and this one here are one and the same?
Or else kin, perhaps? Or no relation at all...
Just how many of the beasts you suppose there are, in all?
Say, remember I asked you for that favor? ...No? Well, never mind then.
You'd think it the end of the world, to look at that sky...
I shall not forget this kindness.
Waaaugh!
Here. For you...
'Twas my master's, once... Better it should serve some purpose now with you.
This gate leads to Cassardis.
Back to Cassardis, Arisen? 'Tis a<cf>fair notion.
A riftstone... A strange power<cf>emanates from within.
We are a vagabond people, born in a<cf>drifting world... We come from the rift.
Touch a riftstone and you can<cf>guide a new pawn to this world.
Seems the soldiers make their beds<cf>there.
'Tis a humbler structure than I'd<cf>imagined.
They've taken some measures against<cf>roaming monsters...
Can a camp of this size truly keep<cf>monsters at bay?
The encampment's a shambles...
The encampment was a humble enough<cf>place before the attack. Now...
Seems it's been abandoned after the<cf>hydra's attack.
I suppose the duke has no intention<cf>of holding this place further.
Where could this gate lead?
'Tis closed... Seems we need<cf>dispensation to pass.
Set out from here and we'll be on<cf>the path to Gran Soren.
Within this tent sits a riftstone.
What purpose do you suppose this<cf>place holds?
The training grounds are used to<cf>instruct men of the Corps in combat.
There are pawns among the armaments,<cf>should you desire their aid.
Are you hungry, Arisen? Such concerns<cf>are somewhat foreign to this pawn.
A sharp blade could cleave its heads<cf>clean off!
Come, we must stop it -- they say<cf>'tis vulnerable at the head.
The damage spreads, Arisen! We must<cf>stop it!
To the best of my knowledge...
We are near a riftstone,<cf>if memory serves.
There may be prowling monsters about.
We've done as asked.<cf>Let us go and give word of it.
Hmm... Shall we search the area?
We pawns travel the rifts connecting<cf>this world with those beyond.
If you find combat a struggle, it may<cf>behoove you to adjust your party.
Whether ranging or fighting, a well-<cf>balanced party is essential.
'Tis a fine time to take stock and<cf>revise our party and equipment.
All ready for battle?
I know the way, Master. Follow me.
It must be near...
If this keeps up, we're done for!
We've no choice... To arms!
No... 'Tis too strong!
Now! Climb its neck!
Now, Arisen! Climb atop it!
I cannot let you past.
Fournival is under lock and key for the duration of the inquest.
The sky offers it considerable vantage... Still, we must fight.
I'll not fall before this is settled!
Die, beast!
So...it ends...
You are blind to the truth, Arisen!
Perdition is nigh! The hour of redemption is upon us!
All will burn, and through fire return to nothingness!
In the name of Salvation, the world must know chaos. The world must know destruction!
The revolt at the Stone of the North? Funny thing, that...
It seems it ended almost before it began.
From the talk of those men still posted there, it was Salvation pulling the strings.
Still no word of Lord Julien, nor Ser Mercedes who went after him...
'Tis a strange thing, indeed.
Then he is dead...
We'd best find Merin.
We must see the message delivered to Merin.
It will not be easy, but we had best go tell Merin.
'Twill only get harder with time, Arisen.<cf>Let's deliver Elvar's message.
Best we deliver Elvar's message<cf>to Merin ere we forget.
The least we can do is pay our<cf>respects to the dead.
Our business here is finished.
Anh.
Aanh!
Eaaaagh!
Mm!
Hmmm!
Giving it your all, cos?
Call again soon, aye?
Aye.
Don't be silly.
Ooh, thank you.
Oh, you are the sweetest, cos!
Fate mocks me...
I'd thought to run. Even made a start of it... Yet here I am again.
It's no great love for the village that keeps me here, truth be told.
It pains me to leave behind patrons who've given me their custom so faithfully.
What good would running do, truly?
I'll not outrun a dragon's wings. If the beast cares to find me, I'll be found.
If there's naught to do but wait and see, I may as well do it here.
I hear tell you've slain some terrible creature?
Are you off to join the duke's army, then?
Seems a dreadful bore, life in the army. And coming from such a carefree life here!
Stay and fish, says I. Drink, and sing, and pass the nights in a lover's embrace.
What more could a person want from life?
I've heard surprising little talk of leaving around the village.
And this, after having lost men to the dragon already.
I know not if it's bravery keeps folks living here, or plain stubbornness.
Whichever it is, I'm thankful for the business!
Those city folk should just come live here, says I.
Any fool knows the capital will be first to fall when the dragon wakes.
You've certainly risen in station, to be in the duke's direct employ...
You have my thanks. Hope is scarce these days.
Knowing brave souls stand against the dragon is a mercy. And to know one in person!
You get the pleasure of knowing dead weight like me. Life is cruel, eh?
Your love was taken!? Maker be merciful...
Talk of the dragon destroying the village or burning the land to ash is too grand to feel real.
It feels more the stuff of legend than a fear could come to pass tomorrow.
To hear someone was taken by the beast, and one so dear to<cf>you...
That's a fear that strikes all too close.
I can offer little more than empty comfort, but I speak with every conviction.
Your love is safe, and you'll be together afore long, I know it.
The Maker would not be so cruel as to part you like this.
What of your love? Safe and sound, I trust!?
It's not my place, I know, but I do urge you cherish what fate's seen fit to spare.
It sounds foolish to say, but...
I feel keeping love alive is every bit as noble as slaying the dragon, and as needed, now.
How fares your love?
I should think you'd earned a respite, for all you've done.
Would that you could return to the simple pleasures of sea, song, and sweet ale!
Life may seem dire now, yet take heart!
All will end well, mark my words. It has till now, and so it will from here onward.
How fares your love?
Oh, you are the sweetest, cos!
Well met, Arisen of the present day, new-forged link in the grand chain...
You have come seeking meaning for that slate and the words it bears... There is none.
None save that it brought you here to me.
My form can be discerned only by true Arisen... I am the Dragonforged.
The slate you bear holds no meaning beyond having brought you here, Arisen.
But take heart. Our meeting shall avail you better than any text could.
My form can be discerned only by true Arisen... I am the Dragonforged.
Is there naught you have to show me, Arisen?
For I have seen it... A cipher, void of meaning unto itself, but of vital importance.
The sign of those bound to the dragon, and through it one another. Bring it here.
Go, now. Tell him that gave you the cipher of what you heard here.

Ngh.
Hrgh!
Gwaaah...
Yoh!
Yah!
What business, ser?
With your leave.
Indeed.
Mmm, no.
Many thanks.
By the Maker... Thank you!
You wandered all this way, with the dragon upon us and all manner of fell creature about?
This is the Greatwall.
It stands between Gransys and the beasts of the pestilent Fetor to the west.
Naught but a deathly waste stretches on west of the Greatwall.
They say it was put to ruin by a dragon long ago, and so it remains now.
This was before the dragon was slain by Edmun Dragonsbane, mind. Long before.
The wyrm's appeared time and again over the ages, leaving death in its wake.
Man, for his part, has left holds like this one, built in hopes of thwarting the beast's wrath.
There's a thick and noisome fog still covers the land beyond the Greatwall. The Fetor, it's called.
It's death to any man fool enough to push west.
The dragon's flown straight to the wastes...off to the Tainted Mountain.
People say it feeds on the Fetor... It's an unnatural thing what draws power from that evil.
The fallen wall's opened a path up the Tainted Mountain. Ill omen indeed...
Then...we're to be spared...?
By the Maker... Thank you!
They say the dragon appeared south of here...
Past the mountain -- a wee fishing village, name of Cassardis.
The dragon took wing toward the mountains in the north, they say.
Many here feared the beast would come for us, but the Maker seems fit to have spared our city.
The dragon appeared out of the clear blue sky, then vanished! Not so much as a scale seen since...
Were I one to wager, I'd say the beast lurks somewhere in the mountains to the north. 
It flew off that direction anyway, and I doubt it circled back without us noticing.
We're frightful short of soldiers along the Greatwall. Are the men of this land truly so craven?
If the dragon were to strike, we'd be hard-pressed to defend the city.
What? The Greatwall has fallen!?
We're...we're done for, then. All hope is lost.
The fleeing citizens say a foul magick threatens to swallow our city into the very earth itself...
Truly, we witness the end of days.
Maker's breath... Not as if this place gets much in the way of visitors, anyhow...
The Arisen, yes? Beg your pardon, but it's not a position I'd care to hold.
Though I wager it's a hair more exciting than my current task...
Ser? You have need of me?
Fournival would have us quit his land? Oh fie, but this is sudden.
Had he even a whit of the Maker's decency, he'd give fair warning afore such a request...
I beg of you, ser, grant me a little time to consider what you say.
I would strive to have an answer for you shortly...
Forgive me, ser, but my mind is yet awhirl with the matter...
I need more time...
It would be madness to stand against Fournival considering my husband's position, to say nothing of our son...
Maker save us! What shall we do?
I swore to you an answer, and I know you come for it...
But please, for pity's sake, just a bit more time.
You have the Maker's patience, ser, and I thank you for it. I've made up my mind:
Though it twist my heart to breaking, we are in no place to defy Fournival's will.
I am my husband's wife in all things. Pray, tell him I will follow whatever path he chooses.
That home is built of our memories...
To simply abandon it, all in the blink of an eye... It is a difficult thing.
Maker bless you, Arisen! You have saved our home!
In truth, I thought such heroes existed only in cradle tales.
I beg of you, take this. It is all I have to show my favor for your efforts.
I am my husband's wife in all things. Pray, tell him I will follow whatever path he chooses.
Pray, if there is ever aught I may do for you, just ask.
I pray this day finds you well, Arisen.
I've little to offer, but I beg you accept this.
Help me!
Surely you don't intend to flee, ser?
Pray, go and tell Ser Aldous of what happened.
Pray, might I beg a favor, Arisen?
Your help would be most welcome in this matter.
Hear him out
Not now
Excellent. Allow me to explain:
A client has asked of us to locate certain raw materials from across the realm.
Such is well and good, but some regions hold more peril than others, the Everfall above all others...
If you might aid us, the first item we require is posted on yon board.
Many thanks, Arisen. I pray no evil befalls you on your journey.
I'll not question your judgment, Arisen. Perhaps some other time.
Aye, that's it for true. Thank you.
The next item we require is on the board.
You yet lack the requested material, Arisen. Pray find it quickly.
Another item we require is on the board.
I've ne'er seen such ill omen.
'Tis the first this pawn has ever<cf>seen anything like this.
The Everfall's base... I'd not think<cf>it possible.
The disquiet in my breast will not<cf>calm...
This blackness... Could it portend an<cf>end to all things?
'Tis cruel, this night.
A force unseen calls out from the<cf>depths. It beckons...
Perhaps the peace we knew is lost for<cf>good and all.
This will never return as it was.
Such a magnificent fortress was<cf>useless in the end.
What took years to build, destroyed<cf>in one instant...
I feel something...from the depths<cf>of the world...
Not a single breeze blows...
The very air itself seems caught<cf>in an ill funk.
It seems as if there is little hope left.
No one could have desired such<cf>destruction...
What is this place?
I mislike the feel of it...
Rrgh...
Dogged bastard...
Yield, damn you!
Unhand me!
Er, well met, ser... Pray, forgive me for the trouble I caused.
I've cast aside thieving, I have. Become an honest man, apprenticed to the innkeep...
I owe the man a debt. You as well, if it please you. You've shown me there's more to life than nursing an empty belly.
I like my life here well, to be sure, but... I need to end my past life properly.
I've a mind to see my old brothers. To leave the fold for good and all...though they'll not like to hear it.
Mfh.
Ooft!
Aaaugh...
Yah!
Hyaaah!
How's the day find you?
Do take care, eh?
Aye, ser.
Oh, no.
Kind of you, ser.
My thanks!
No, ser! You can't pass!
None of that, now!
Can't run forever!
Away with you!
All right, go along.
Hold right there.
No use struggling.
Where in the Maker's name...
There! There!
Hurry, men! Go!
We'll be needing to tighten the watch.
What need has the duke for tribute, at such a cost?
'Tis like too late to do anything now.
Don't bother yourself. 'Tis done.
Naught to do about it now, save forget and move on.
What, d'you need something?
I'm trying to work here. Move along.
I'm trying to keep focus. A fellow has to stay ready...
I'll do all I can for His Grace an' this fine land.
What's a few monsters before warriors like you an' me, eh?
Seems everywhere is coming up short of men...
I'll fight to the end. For the sake of my family...
Someone, help...
No...
I still can't believe it...
Merciful Maker...
My thanks!
So you are Arisen...
This may come as small surprise, but I know well the path you walk.
For you see, I myself was once Arisen.
And this girl, Selene...was my pawn.
The soul of an Arisen cannot but affect their follower. Given time, the pawn will assume the Arisen's very form.
This is the "bestowal of spirit," or so I named it.
I did not grasp the full meaning of this transfer when first I noticed it.
But see well Selene. See how she resembles me. I pray she can soon live her life as a human true.
Age and experience separate us, Arisen, but I know you ken my words.
Selene is more than pawn now. She yearns to choose the course of her life, free from the will of others.
If you can aid in this, there may yet be a future for her.
If you can aid in this, there may yet be a future for her.
Yes. I see it now.
In truth, I had long thought as much. The ways of pawns and humans are so very close.
You can, Selene.
The bestowal of spirit granted you my heart.
As you learned of the world, you filled this heart with feelings of your own.
Pawns are but shadows of life, doomed to forever echo out across the rift.
But soon you will be freed of this unending cycle...
Then will your thoughts belong to you alone. Then will you speak with your own voice.
Ah, it's you. Mason told me to expect you.
If you've a message, I could relay it.
...The knight, then, is it? Fine then, I'll pass the word along.

Am I... Am I dying...?
That man you were speaking with... He's o' the pawn legion.
They come from some unknown place. Just appear, without a warning. They're a strange lot.
Not human, quite. They look the part sure enough, but they lack the will...the spark what drives us.
They have no capacity to feel nor act alone, so they live as sellswords. Myrmidons, they're called.
Mm... There's an encampment west of the village where men gather to face the dragon.
I'd wager a fair number of his kind will be there as well.
Why don't you take him? Might be you learn aught o' why he came to you in the first place.
That pawn'll be looking to head west to the encampment, no doubt.
Why don't you see him there? He'll not make the trip on his own.
His kind'll rot where they stand, 'less a human orders them to move.
Why not see that pawn to the encampment? Might be you'll find aught there as well.
I bid you safe travels, and remember: This place will ever be<cf>your home.
You'll have a home here with us always, come what may.

[A notification from Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen]<cf>It seems our pawns have met beyond the rifts. As they have joined the bonds of amity, mayhap we may as well. If you would, accept this friend request.
- Lettre de Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen-<cf>Nos pions se sont rencontrés au-delà de la faille. Peut-être que cette union permettra de sceller un pacte d'amitié entre nos deux royaumes respectifs. Si vous le désirez, acceptez cette requête d'ami.
[Eine Nachricht von Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen]<cf>Es scheint, als hätten sich unsere Vasallen jenseits des Rifts getroffen. Da sie dabei freundschaftliche Bande geschlossen haben, sollten wir das vielleicht auch tun. Falls Ihr diese Freundschaftsanfrage annehmt.
[Nota da Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen]<cf>Le nostre pedine si sono incontrate oltre la faglia. Hanno sigillato un patto di amicizia e forse potremmo farlo anche noi. Se vuoi, accetta questa richiesta di aggiunta di un amico.
Solicitud de amistad de otro Arisen:<cf><cf>Mi peón me ha dicho que ha conocido al tuyo más allá de la falla y que han vivido aventuras juntos. Así que he pensado que quizá tú y yo podríamos ser amigos también. ¿Qué te parece?

Hm? Ah, it's you. The Arisen.
You've been granted free walk of the castle, but that's no cause to go making trouble.
Trouble means more work for me, and more work is nothing I need.
I've said my piece.
Long as you stay out from underfoot, I don't care a whit what you get up to. Do as you like.
It's Salvation, isn't it? The ones making trouble out at the Greatwall.
Sorry to say a fair number of the duke's men have cast their lot with those zealots.
I put no truck in their madness, myself.
Though I can understand what might drive a man to it...
Even the stoutest of us is afraid.
We all know the dragon's coming, and we all know there's naught we can do to stop it.
I will defend this castle with my life!
Not that it means a damn, given how quick I'm like to die if the wyrm does show.
A Warm Welcome
As the dragon breathed its last, the sky dimmed<cf>and the earth shook. Monsters grew in might. Are<cf>the duke and his capital safe?








Return to Gran Soren
A foul wind blows across the land... Make for<cf>the capital to see how it fares.



Meet With Duke Edmun
The once-proud city is in a pitiable state.<cf>Travel to the castle and to Duke Edmun's<cf>side.



Duel the Duke
Something is amiss with Duke Edmun. He<cf>insists on fighting you, so fight you must.



Make Good Your Escape
You are branded a traitor, to be taken dead<cf>or alive. Evade your pursuers and flee Gran<cf>Soren.

In truth, our first duty is to repair the broken pier...
Might be rewarding, in its own way.
But I'll not be back on my boat for a fair bit -- that much is certain.
Of late, I find my thoughts turning to my father.
He joined the Maker last year... Sometimes, I...I wonder if I might be happier, up with him...
Working the sea leaves little time for fretting.
All right, what next?
Steady on, goodfisher.
In truth, our first duty is to repair the broken pier...
You've truly come for me!
I've yearned to see you so...<cf>All this time...

Hail, Arisen! My thanks again for your aid in time past!
I have come now to lend my support, with the same prize you claimed for me!
Let us see how the creature takes to my arcane magick!
What say you to that, beast!?
'Tis a taste of old Salomet's grimoire!
What...? This cannot be!
Salomet's grimoire has failed!? But...that is not possible...
Waugh! S-stop!
Waaaugh!
Well? Did I seem the hero, racing to the aid of those in peril?
Truth be told, 'twas happenstance that delivered me.
I was tracing the steps of the sorcerer Salomet -- they led me here.
Upon my arrival I see you, locked in combat with a griffin!
I knew it for a golden opportunity. And I daresay I stole the show!
No need for thanks, ser. No need at all!
'Tis an enigma most puzzling...
A grimoire simply cannot fail so. ...Not unless it be a forgery.
But that cannot... Ser, is this... Not that I suspect you, mind!
It's only-- Well-- Hmm...
Now, choose. Stand against me, or speak your<cf>wish.
Offer your beloved in forfeit, and I shall see your<cf>will done.
Very well... If that be your wish, I shall claim my<cf>price.
To know the unknown--that was my dream.
To walk new frontiers and ancient halls<cf>alike, and to see all that this world holds.
I was prepared to overcome any obstacle<cf>that barred my wandering.
And so, when the dragon plucked the heart from my breast, I<cf>knew only joy. With new power and ageless life, I was free.
I knew no greater treasure than freedom. No<cf>higher virtue. And yet...
What drove me, then, to take him with me? What ought have<cf>seemed a fetter became my greatest joy. My greatest love.
And now... I haven't even the freedom of my own will.
I followed the Arisen's path, past the wyrm<cf>and to the halls of the world-steward...
And there, my path ended.
In defeat, I was remade a dragon.
From the moment I donned a dragon's skin,<cf>I was controlled by a single, driving urge--
To serve the Seneschal.
This one thought consumed me, its pull inexorable.
It was a hunger. An instinctual need.
I burned for one who would defeat me. Who would<cf>succeed where I had fallen. I craved the new Arisen.
It is man's will that animates him.
Can a being devoid of will truly be said to live?
Am I alive, as I am now?
The will that drives this cursed form to<cf>seek the Arisen is not my own.
My will, my love, and all I am is crushed beneath its weight.<cf>Its force does not allow me even the luxury of regret.
I am near drunk with it, though I war against<cf>it still with every shred of what once I was.
In my final act as a thinking being, I chose<cf>him for my destroyer.
The question fell from my lips unbidden--
What is your choice?
Were it his wish, I would welcome death at<cf>his hands. Nay, I desired it.
But his wavering gave voice to a new wish.
That the world, its gods, and he himself be damned.
My role was set. My actions bound.
I existed in that moment solely to give his wishes form.
And so I did. I answered his desire, his cry of despair...
And his love, my former shadow, was the price.
My dreams have died, unfulfilled.
Though I have neither the means to change that fact nor<cf>the free will to mourn them, perhaps...
Perhaps what has transpired will serve some greater use.
Let it be as a wedge struck into the chains that bind our<cf>endless, hollow world, that those to follow may shatter them.
I failed in my quest to explore the unknown.
But if it serve some use in ending this cruel<cf>cycle, I can believe my life held meaning.
Guh.
Gaah!
Gwaaaugh...
Hah!
Shyeah!
Ever a pleasure.
Till next time, then.
Aye.
No.
Ah, kind of you.
That's a real treat. My thanks!
If you've a moment to spare, you've a moment to browse.
Here. Today's offerings.
Ahh, you've quite the eye.
Pretty little collection, aye?
I've slashed my prices, friend! ...A bit.
Noticed it, have you? That's the one.
I'm a merchant, not a moneylender.
I'd call this fair, aye?
Here we are! Aye, leave it to me.
Here, take it.
Suits me fine.
Not a chance.
Don't s'pose this place holds anything more for me.
Right... Next is Cassardis. I've a longing for the sea breeze.
A merchant's naught without patrons. I'm for Gran Soren's crowds, next.
Hmm, where to set up shop next... Been awhile since I've seen the abbey's walls.
Per'aps I'll go ply my wares at the encampment. If the Enlistment Corps is still there, that is.
The men of the front are apt to need all manner of supplies. I'm off to the Greatwall.
I fear you've caught me sold out of stock, friend. Pray, call again.
Say, that's quite the trinket, this ring.
What, you intend for me to have it? There's a queer surprise indeed.
Not that I won't accept it, mind. And happily, too.
If you've occasion to pass by, I'm ever happy to serve.
Hoy there. Been some time, hasn't it? Enough time to become well famous, in your case.
The Arisen... Heh, 'tis the second coming of Duke Dragonsbane, I daresay.
I like it, friend. I like it well.
I aim to linger here, for a time.
Still, I'll not stay on forever. If there's aught catches your eye, best buy it up quick.
Hmm, I feel as if we've met someplace. Per'aps not...
I'm called Reynard, a traveling merchant. Perchance our paths will cross again. If so, do not be a stranger, eh?
I aim to linger here, for a time.
Still, I'll not stay on forever. If there's aught catches your eye, best buy it up quick.
A favor? Ohh, that... Well, no matter now.
I've been at my wandering a year now, all around Gransys.
Seems some things lost are loath to be found anew...
Mm? Ah, pay it no mind. Idle muttering, friend.
Seems some things lost are loath to be found anew...
Traveling about in this line teaches a fellow things.
Like how nothing stays in one place for long --people less still.
My blackguard father least of all...
Seems some things lost are loath to be found anew...
My head feels clear, somehow. Like a man finally free from the haze of a night's drinking.
When I felt the wyrm's talons about me, sure I was a dead man, all went black a moment.
Then there you were, somehow. In my mind, I saw you.
I knew it sure as the sky is blue, that you would come for me.
My head's held little but thought of my father these years past.
With nothing to drive me on...no purpose to clutch to my breast, I faltered.
'Tis only natural that a man left hollow should fall, no different than a rotted tree.
But I am hollow no more.
Not empty, but a clean slate. Free of all that's burdened me.
I feel ready to begin anew. To start fresh.
Together, with you.

You've no place here.
Aanh?
I've no use for you.
Keep your distance, filth.
Don't get cocky, you.
Scared, are you?
Be off with you.
Why are you here?
Hoy there. You look eager.
To living easy, aye?
The air is heavy, and...somehow sad.
'Tis difficult to breathe down here.
What oarsman has come to find this place?
An epitaph, perhaps...?
I never dreamed the Cassardi sea held such<cf>an island.
'Tis an isle unknown to any map I've seen.
Perhaps your summons here holds some<cf>deeper meaning, master.
She bears a melancholy air.
I'll wager she's a tale to tell...
I sense an aura much like your own from<cf>her, master.
Has she always lived here?
It seems even she herself knows little of<cf>this place.
Best we gave her any cursed items we find.
Aiding one another is our only hope in<cf>surviving such a place.
Seems her mind is in precarious shape...
The unease of not clearly knowing one's<cf>self is aught I can sympathize with.
Beneath the rage and despair, I sensed still<cf>other human emotion from the beast...
'Twas a fitting creator for such a monstrous<cf>place.
We'll have need of strategy if we aim to<cf>match such a titan in combat.
I feel the ghost of a scream echo in my<cf>ears... or perhaps it is an ardent plea.
If our preparations are not complete,<cf>best we paused to make them so.
If we aim to face it again, best we were<cf>cautious about it.
Haste will buy us naught, and timeless<cf>fiends can well wait for us to form a plan.
The belly of the beast bore the dragon's<cf>aspect...
Just what was that?
It felt as nothing from this world, nor any<cf>other I have known.
Such a bizarre and grotesque form... Is it<cf>yet to reveal its true nature?
You are our pillar, Arisen. Pray, do not<cf>let a base fiend shake your resolve.
It felt...alien. I've no other word for it.
What is its true aim, d'you suppose?
We shall face it when time and tide are<cf>right.
The pawn legion will aid you with the sum<cf>of our being, as ever.
It seems the Olra we met was but the soul<cf>within another's flesh.
To think the soul of another might dwell<cf>within the body of an Arisen... Extraordinary.
I'd ne'er believed in the transmigration of<cf>souls... Or is this some other force at work?
This Olra must have been possessed of an<cf>exceptionally strong will.
Each Arisen who came to this place met a<cf>different end...
This pawn is ever concerned for your future,<cf>Arisen.
I pray you will see your journey through.
What meaning do you suppose those<cf>stones hold?
'Tis a portcrystal. With a ferrystone,<cf>you could reach it from anywhere.
'Tis a Portcrystal, Master.
Poor Baudric... He wasn't always mad, you know. 
He was once a scholar of renown... Spent his days pouring over tomes about what lies beyond the rift. 
One day, he up and vanished. We all took him for perished, but after a time there he was, wandering the city, spouting his sing-songy rattle...
Poor Baudric... He wasn't always mad, you know. 
You've spoken to Baudric? Or heard him, more like... The way he talks, all in verse like that... Some days I take him for a prophet.
In truth, Baudric frightens me. I'm a simple woman, unschooled in the arts, and yet...
What if Baudric speaks truth? What if we are none of us alive...?
Days are I'm not sure what unnerves me more: Baudric's talk or that dragon.
So you're the Arisen, then? Hmm...yes...
Pardon, ser. I was simply curious what caliber hero would be given us this time, nothing more.
To mount the pedestal and bear the hopes of all the people... It is not an easy path to trod.
You shall discover so for yourself ere long, I am sure...
You are to see me for your assignments, and no one else.
I speak for His Grace on such matters -- my word is his. As such, any task deserves your full and immediate attention. 
Pray, make your choice, ser.
Aid the Corps on a hunting expedition
Gather evidence for an important trial
None for now
Many within the castle praise your bold deeds of late. I pray such good works continue apace.
I've more tasks that require your attention. Pray, make your choice, ser.
Recover stolen item
Assist Ser Mercedes
None for now
In that case, inform me at once when you might accept a task.
The weight of duty lies heavy on your shoulders. Never forget it.
Perhaps we'd best ask around.
Someone here may know of her<cf>whereabouts.
No trace of Madeleine... Perhaps someone<cf>in the area has news of her.
Madeleine will be wanting her dagger<cf>returned.
Just what trouble has Madeleine brought<cf>upon herself now?
I fear Madeleine is caught up in an<cf>intrigue well beyond her ken.
Where would she hide...? An alleyway?<cf>Or an abandoned house?
We'll scour every corner of the capital if<cf>we must.
We know too little. Perhaps we'll find<cf>another witness?
Others must have seen what happened.<cf>Let's ask around.
Someone just ran past below us!
Madeleine fled along the waterway<cf>below us!
Someone must know something about<cf>this matter. Let's ask around.
Help me!

I can fret over that once I've weathered the dragon here.
I hear it told you're the Arisen.
The region I hail from seldom sees so much as a pawn, let alone one such as you.
So, what then? You're off to slay the dragon for us? Is that it?
Take heart, Arisen, and go with all my prayers. I've no desire to die in this city.
Is it done, then? Are we saved? You wouldn't think it, to look at the sky...
Oh, that's simply wonderful!
'Twas a matter of moments... The earth gaped wide and swallowed up all those people...
I did naught but stand and watch... What could I have done for them?
I took an oath to protect Gran Soren's people. To protect the duke... I was a fool to think I could...

I would beg a favor as you're running about on the duke's business, ser.
There is a person I seek. Might I ask your help?
Accept
Not now
I've another request from someone looking for hired steel. Might I beg your help again?
Accept
Not now
Wonderful. You are perfectly suited to the task, dear Arisen.
As I said, I seek a man. Or I should say a pawn, to be more precise.
I would ask you to procure a pawn matching the description I proffer.
Many of my clients have specific tastes in a myrmidon's look and ability, you see.
I've writ the details out in a brief, ser. Pray, read it well.
Pray, keep on just as you have, ser. You've all the details in the brief I gave you.
Just come and speak to me once you've brought another. You have my thanks, Arisen.
Perfect, ser. 'Tis just as I wrote.
You are ever apt, dear Arisen. I shall be sure to alert you if I've similar need in the future.
...Did you read the brief I gave you, ser? You've not brought the pawn I've specified.
I do not require your imagination, ser. Pray, keep to the instructions?
Come now, friend. Surely you can make time amid your travels. Aye?
Accept
Not now
Ah, well. If you've not the time, there's naught to be done for it, I suppose.
Impressive work, Arisen. No doubt the duke would agree.
The challenge is in bringing your trophy to him... I'll have my men ready a cart.
You'll come to the capital as well, of course. Pray, rest while the preparations are made.
I've sent for a cart to carry your trophy to the capital.
You'll come to the capital as well, of course. Pray, rest while the preparations are made.
The wait is over, Arisen. We've lashed the beast's head to a cart.
I shall send word of our coming to the men of the waycastle. We'll take to the road at dawn.
I cannot say what the pass may hold. You'll need your strength. Rest well tonight.
Understood.
Hold a moment.
Good. Rest up, men -- we leave at first light.
Ah, you needn't wake at the same unkind hour as we, Arisen.
The pass truly bares its fangs beyond the waycastle. That is when we shall most need your assistance.
'Twill be slow going with a cart. I daresay you'll have no trouble catching up.
We'll meet at the waycastle. Till then, I bid you rest well. 'Tis a long road ahead.
Good. Rest up, men.
What, you have some business here yet?
Time is scarce. A rotten head makes for a poor trophy.
We make for the capital, men.
Like as not, the cart will draw beasts along the way. Stay vigilant!
But fear not. We walk with the Arisen, slayer of hydras!
We make for the capital, men.
Like as not, the cart will draw beasts along the way. Stay vigilant!
Keep close, Arisen. The duke will have no use for you dead.
Even goblins can be a threat, and they walk the roads openly of late.
Take no chances, men. Cut them down on sight.
There! Goblins!
Stop the cart and prepare to engage them.
We must hold them until the gate opens!
The trail is worn rough... Tread with care.
Danger can come from any quarter. Be ready.
They come from above! Ready yourselves!
Is it the serpent's blood that draws them?
We cannot turn back. Stand strong and press onward!
Augh... Poor souls.
The monsters grow bolder by the day. Perhaps the coming of the dragon stirs aught within them.
The creatures come! Cut them down, men!
We're not far now, men!
Keep marching!
Good, we've come this far safely.
Stay vigilant till we're in Gran Soren's gates, men!
Fallen rock bars the path.
This leads on to the capital. We'll come upon a gate presently.
Keep moving, men. Onward!
Ser Mercedes, Captain of the Enlistment Corps, is returned. Lay open the gate!
The gate is open! Onward, men!
Stay calm! There must be aught here that will open the gate!
You made it... Good.
I trust you rested well, given the hour. The Arisen arose late this day, eh?
There, ahead! Gran Soren is in sight!
We are nearly there, men! Now, march!
Were you lost, Arisen? I would thank you to take better care hence.
Now, let us be on our way. The castle stands at the city's rear.
What held you, Arisen? I trust you can at least keep step with an ox.
We've delayed long enough. Come, we cross the pass now.
We've arrived. Well done, men.
A hydra's head is a fine prize. His Grace will be pleased with the Corps's work.
Walk proud through these streets, men. We are heroes to the people of Gran Soren!
The pass is a dangerous place. Crossing with freight in tow is no simple task.
All the same, we must go to the capital. We'll set out once more as soon as we're prepared.
I cannot say what the pass may hold. You'll need your strength.
'Twill be slow going with a cart. I daresay you'll have no trouble catching up.
Accept
Not now
We'll meet at the waycastle. Till then, I bid you rest well. 'Tis a long road ahead.
What, you have some business here yet?
Time is scarce. A rotten head makes for a poor trophy.
You dispatched the hydra with a master's ease, Arisen.

'Tis locked. You haven't the key to fit it...
'Tis caught on something. Perhaps it could open from the far side.
'Tis barred shut. Might be able to break the bolt.
'Tis shut tight.
'Tis no use at this hour. You'll have to come again later.
Best stop for now.
Seems they're closed.
Someone was here...
Lost them...
Gone...
Perhaps you've upset them.
There's naught to do here.
Best you moved on.
Not here...
The door is closed.
Shows no sign of opening.
There's aught there...
You don't see anything.
That smell...
Someone's near...
What's this...?
Fine view from here.
There's aught written here...
Must be a way to find something...
Smells delicious.
Perfect spot to place something.
You can almost reach...
There appears to be aught ahead.
That fall could kill.
'Tis dangerous to touch.
A strong blow might break it.
Perhaps if you came by night.
Perhaps if you came by day.
Perhaps if you came at dawn.
Perhaps if you came at dusk.
There's aught buried here...
You see no way up.
'Tis slick, this spot.
No use pressing any further.
No need to double back further.
No time for that now.
You cannot carry any more.
There may yet be aught lying about.
Seems there's naught you can take on at present.<cf>Best to try again later.
Perhaps with a bit of help...
Best you kept your weapon sheathed.
Is someone here...?
'Tis a place for tall folk.
'Tis a place for small folk.
Had you a woman in your band...
Had you a man in your band...
Had you a strong companion...
Had you a swift companion...
Had you a magick user...
Had you an apt climber...
Had you a skilled jumper...
This weapon will not help you.
That armor won't protect you.
You're ill equipped for this.
Seems it can't be used now.
You'll get no further use from it.
'Tis useless, now.
Hmm, not with your current equipment...
Not with your current party...
You hear aught from further in.
Enemies... They're close.
Best you got some rest.
You can carry no more!
You're too exhausted!
"Danger! Keep Out!"
"No Trespassing"
A sign.
Had you an Empty Flask, you might fill it here.
You'll get no further without a lantern.
'Tis dangerous to fumble about in the dark. Best find a light.
Best not just leave them.
If aught were left here, it would rot.
Best take care you don't get lost.
Best check the map.
You're due for a rest.
This place is dangerous by night.
This place is dangerous by day.
Breathtaking...
You'll get no further!
Seems you'll need to come back.
Nothing left here.
It looks fit to crumble.
Seems it could be moved...
It will not budge.
It will not open.
Seems you need a key.
Seems you need a Pickaxe here.
You yet lack the experience.
You yet lack the skill.
Not with your current vocation...
You'll not pass through this gate.
You've no time!
Seems you were too late.
You may make it, yet.
You're doing well for time.
Seems you've come at the wrong time.
There may be another path.
'Tis fallen to ruin... You'll ne'er get through it.
'Tis a powerful weapon... Too bad it doesn't work.
A pitiful end...
'Tis one of your countrymen...or was, at least.<cf>An ignoble fate.
The dragon will pay for this, sure as you draw<cf>breath.
Such atrocity...

'Tis shut tight. A passageway can be seen through the bars.
'Tis a riftstone, a stone etched with strange markings. It may be used to summon pawns from beyond.
The markings glow no longer. It seems pawns may not be summoned now.
You may not proceed from here.
Another fallen...
The blood has already left the face of this poor<cf>wretch.
This corpse wears an expression of sheer terror.
No hope left for this one...
The rubble is too thick to clamber across.
The gate is shut tight. You sense a presence on the other side...
<TUTO 5>Icons alongside your health gauge will <cf>indicate any such changes to your status.

<TUTO>Invoking this stone can gain you new allies<cf>known as "pawns", whose loyalty in battle<cf>will never falter.
A large door... Opens by some switch, most like.
No further response, it seems.
You can see a full description of any<cf>item you possess by checking your<cf>inventory with <TUTO><SIZE 28><ICON PAD_SL></SIZE>.
Select "Status" from the Pause Menu to<cf>view details on your current condition.

Pressing <TUTO><SIZE 28><ICON STAT_CHANGE></SIZE> will draw your<cf>primary weapon.
A Ferrystone will spirit you back to Gran<cf>Soren in an instant, no matter where you<cf>are located.
It is by far the fastest and safest method<cf>of travel, but each stone disappears after<cf>a single use.
You can equip yourself with a primary and<cf>a secondary weapon.
Primary weapons such as swords and daggers<cf>are combat essentials. Secondary weapons<cf>like bows and shields offer support.
In addition to weapons and armor, you can<cf>also equip accoutrements with certain special<cf>abilities to give you an edge in battle.
Only one piece of jewelry and a single<cf>cloak can be equipped as accoutrements<cf>at any one time.
A heavy load will cause your Stamina to<cf>deplete more quickly. Sell or discard<cf>any and all items you no longer need.
Your lantern consumes oil. If it dims,<cf>use a Flask of Oil to refill it.

Note that you move somewhat slower while<cf>your weapon is drawn.
Exhausting all Stamina will make you unable<cf>to act for a time. Take care to conserve<cf>energy!
You can attack while clinging to foes.
Petrifaction cannot be cured by normal<cf>magick, and is fatal if left untreated.
Use Secret Softener or the like to<cf>cure any petrified allies.
Your rank within a vocation rises as you<cf>defeat foes and complete quests. At higher<cf>ranks, a broader variety of skills are available.
Defeating foes and completing quests earns<cf>you more discipline, boosting your prowess<cf>in a vocation.
Pawns will collect and use items of their<cf>own volition.
You cannot carry or purchase items that<cf>would cause you to exceed your maximum<cf>encumbrance.
Press <TUTO><SIZE 25><ICON TOUCH></SIZE> while climbing down a ladder<cf>to descend quickly. 
If a pawn remains unconscious for too long,<cf>they will be forfeit.
Your support pawn has become forfeit, and<cf>returned to the realm whence they came.
Your main pawn has become forfeit,<cf>disappearing and returning to the rift.
You cannot join covenants with other pawns<cf>while your main pawn is forfeit.
Touch any riftstone to return your lost<cf>main pawn to your side.
If a support pawn is forfeit, any items<cf>they were carrying are sent to item storage.
You can send off departing pawns with a<cf>single item as a gift for their creator.
You can pass items to and from your pawns<cf>on the sub menu.
All through my reign, I foresaw the coming of this danger.
And so I gathered men into armies, stones into strongholds. I readied for war.
And then you, Arisen... You came to us, and the dragon with you.
Pray, think on the meaning of that, and on your duty.
Carry on in your endeavors for the duchy, Arisen.
As long as you've the will to fight, I shall see you are granted the opportunity.
This is the Arisen's doing?
'Tis locked. You haven't the key to fit it...
'Tis caught on something. Perhaps it could open from the far side.
'Tis barred shut. Might be able to break the bolt.
'Tis shut tight.
'Tis no use at this hour. You'll have to come again later.
Best stop for now.
Seems they're closed.
Someone was here...
Lost them...
Gone...
Perhaps you've upset them.
There's naught to do here.
Best you moved on.
Not here...
The door is closed.
Shows no sign of opening.
There's aught there...
You don't see anything.
That smell...
Someone's near...
What's this...?
Fine view from here.
There's aught written here...
Must be a way to find something...
Smells delicious.
Perfect spot to place something.
You can almost reach...
There appears to be aught ahead.
That fall could kill.
'Tis dangerous to touch.
A strong blow might break it.
Perhaps if you came by night.
Perhaps if you came by day.
Perhaps if you came at dawn.
Perhaps if you came at dusk.
There's aught buried here...
You see no way up.
'Tis slick, this spot.
No use pressing any further.
No need to double back further.
No time for that now.
You cannot carry any more.
There may yet be aught lying about.
Seems there's naught you can take on at present.<cf>Best to try again later.
Perhaps with a bit of help...
Best you kept your weapon sheathed.
Is someone here...?
'Tis a place for tall folk.
'Tis a place for small folk.
Had you a woman in your band...
Had you a man in your band...
Had you a strong companion...
Had you a swift companion...
Had you a magick user...
Had you an apt climber...
Had you a skilled jumper...
This weapon will not help you.
That armor won't protect you.
You're ill equipped for this.
Seems it can't be used now.
You'll get no further use from it.
'Tis useless, now.
Hmm, not with your current equipment...
Not with your current party...
You hear aught from further in.
Enemies... They're close.
Best you got some rest.
You can carry no more!
You're too exhausted!
"Danger! Keep Out!"
"No Trespassing"
A sign.
Had you an Empty Flask, you might fill it here.
You'll get no further without a lantern.
'Tis dangerous to fumble about in the dark. Best find a light.
Best not just leave them.
If aught were left here, it would rot.
Best take care you don't get lost.
Best check the map.
You're due for a rest.
This place is dangerous by night.
This place is dangerous by day.
Breathtaking...
You'll get no further!
Seems you'll need to come back.
Nothing left here.
It looks fit to crumble.
Seems it could be moved...
It will not budge.
It will not open.
Seems you need a key.
Seems you need a Pickaxe here.
You yet lack the experience.
You yet lack the skill.
Not with your current vocation...
You'll not pass through this gate.
You've no time!
Seems you were too late.
You may make it, yet.
You're doing well for time.
Seems you've come at the wrong time.
There may be another path.
'Tis a powerful weapon... Too bad it doesn't work.
Something strong can be sensed from the stone. It <cf>appears the memories of someone have been etched<cf>upon the surface of the Monument of Remembrance.
Krgh.
Gragh...
Waaaugh...
Hah.
Rragh!
Well met, ser.
Until next time.
Yes.
No.
My thanks.
With all that I am, I thank you.
I'd thought better of you!
You'll not evade justice!
Why...?
This is madness!
Pardon, ser, but I am caught in preparations for a task of great importance.
I fear I am not at liberty to speak at the moment.
'Tis plain that Salvation's only aim is to sow chaos among the people.
It's no noble cause what drives them. No code guides their actions. They are not even beholden to greed, or base desires. Truly, I can think of no more dangerous sort.
I have heard tale of your feats at the encampment, ser. You fought with the valor of a hundred men. Legends of the Arisen's power ring true, it seems.
Tell me, ser. What think you of this spate of monster attacks?
At risk of sounding mad, or else just cruel, I must say I cannot help but feel mankind must bear some part in it.
Such calamity as we are stricken with now seems a message from the Maker. A warning, if you will.
Perhaps the Arisen exists as mankind's answer to that warning. A force to right imbalance, to correct ill...
But forgive me. I speak of strange notions far beyond my ken.
Carelessness kills quick as steel on the field of war. Pray, take care, ser.
Those who bear the title of the Arisen carry a heavy burden, regardless of their choosing.
I pray you have the resolve to see it through, ser.
These years since I first came into the service of the duke, I have ever studied arms and the art of combat in preparation for what may come.
Though I wish war could be avoided outright, I am eager now to be of use to the people of Gransys.
Death in service of the duke is both the honor and the duty of all who bear arms in his name. May we both live to serve him well.
What do you make of the dragon's attacks of late, ser?
At risk of sounding mad, or else just cruel, I must say I cannot help but feel mankind must bear some part in it.
As Arisen, you are by now the very heart of the duke's force. The land could ill survive without you.
And yet... You seem largely unencumbered by the weight of that responsibility.
I cannot fathom why His Grace should choose one such as you to... Forgive me. I misspeak, ser.
Are you resting properly, ser? The tasks before you ill leave room for exhaustion.
With you go the hopes of all Gransys, Arisen. Pray, tread with care.
The monsters' encroachment spreads by the day.
We cannot-- We must not allow them to breach Gran Soren's walls.
We've no time to dally.
Completing our tasks as quickly as we're able is the only way to keep Gran Soren safe, and with it His Grace and all his people...
Forgotten your charge, Arisen? I've seen to it myself.
I... I am lost, ser, and grievous confused.
My judgment has escaped me... How am I to respond to what has happened?
I'll not beg an explanation... I suspect none exists.
I ask only your forgiveness, Arisen. I must abide by my duty!
With all that I am, I thank you.
We've been keeping watch upon Salvation for some time.
I fear the dragon's coming has opened the people's ears to their heresies.
They're led by a man calling himself the Elysion.
The man is clearly mad. 'Tis wisest to ignore the fool outright...
But it will not do to suffer his rantings sowing doubt among the duke's subjects.
We make for the Stone of the<cf>Southwest.
The captain will be about here<cf>somewhere. Let's seek him out.
Best we begin by speaking with the<cf>captain.
Judging from his fine armor, that<cf>man is likely to be the captain.
We should avoid battle if possible.
Let's look for a way underground!
We must find a way to open the gate!
The device to open the gate must<cf>be nearby...
The lever to operate this must be<cf>here somewhere...
We've no choice but to scale that<cf>ladder.
With the lever in place, we can open<cf>the gate.
Come! We strike them hard and fast!
The advantage is ours!
Let's put these beasts to rout!
We must aid our allies!
Assisting the knights will make this<cf>an easy battle!
Our victory is at hand!
The tides turn in our favor, friends!
The duke's men are a hearty lot!<cf>I daresay the day is ours!
I'll wager their leader's death will<cf>quiet the horde!
The goblins will be waiting for us,<cf>of that you can be sure.
This road will take us to the quarry.
The ancient quarry lies this way,<cf>Arisen.
We're at the mouth of the quarry.<cf>Stay watchful.
The quarry stands beyond.
We need only follow the map from<cf>here, Master.
An imposing gate... We'll not get<cf>through this way.
We've no way to breach the gate.<cf>Best find another route.
Door or stairway, we'd best proceed<cf>with caution.
'Tis wiser to take the stairs. Get a<cf>view of the place from above.
Perhaps that opens the door? It looks<cf>incomplete.
We'll need the missing part to make<cf>use of the switch. Let's look around.
The switch is only useful to us<cf>whole. Let's search the cottage.
Perhaps we'll find aught inside?
There must be some way in. Let's have<cf>a closer look at the walls.
Hmm... A small person might well slip<cf>through.
This should allow us to open the<cf>front gate.
Let's have that gate open!<cf>To the rooftop, Arisen!
Their leader is here somewhere,<cf>hidden. Let's seek him out!
The road to the southwest hold is long<cf>and unfamiliar. We'd best hire a guide.
The Stone of the Southwest... 'Tis<cf>far to the south, beyond the quarry.
This is a fight best avoided,<cf>master...
Their numbers make them a threat.
We can climb up here.
Stay wary!
Do not let down your guard.
We'll need a light to get<cf>through this darkness.
We're here.
'Tis also advisable to bring along a<cf>pawn well familiar with the road.
There's a way down here.
We'll face a fierce battle, no doubt.<cf>Best be prepared.
We know not what's inside...best be<cf>prepared for anything.

Thank you for playing!
This is a story with no beginning and no end.<cf>It only is, and has been, since time eternal.
It has always served to give hope to those<cf>links in the eternal chain that binds all...
knowing only what needs be known, doing only what needs be done. Can man not resist that simple, meaningless action?
Come all this way, are you?
I fear you'll find nothing here to merit the journey.
Naught at all is the most welcome report from a stronghold.
'Tis a fool goes about stirring up trouble without good cause.
What? I... I've done nothing wrong. Only done my duty, I have, same as ever.
You're mistaken, I assure you.
What are you lookin' at?
Off with ye!
Lookin' to bleed, are ye?
Bugger off!
If you've no business here, move on.
Best mind what you do here.
What is it?
I've naught to say to you.
Come to join our little band?
'Ow's the road treating you, cousin?
Why are you here!?
Piss off!
Who d'you fancy you are?
You're not welcome here.
We don't suffer trespassers.
Eager to die, friend?
Be off with you!
You're daft, friend.
Have you naught better to do?
Still here, are you?
How do you fare?
Hoy!
Those rotten...
'Tis a poor jest...
...Truly?
We ought to have finished them earlier.
We'll do for them, we will...
Aye, we will...
What?
I see...
And what then?
Ngh.
Hnngh!
Guhagh...nngh...
Yoh!
Taah!
'Ello, 'ello.
Fare well, then. Fare well.
Oh, aye.
That's just not so.
Sorry for the trouble.
Say, that's lovely, ser.
If you've time to spare, you've time for a look-see.
Ahh, good eye, ser.
Right nice collection, aye?
I've discounted my wares, ser. Just for you, mind.
Spotted it, eh? That's the one.
I'm trying to run a business here, ser.
How's this sound, then?
Here we are! Aye, leave it to me.
Here, take it.
Suits me fine.
Not a chance.
Oh, a customer, is it? Alon, ser. I travel these parts peddling my wares.
If you see me out in your travels, do give a shout.
Always happy to serve, I am.
What, you're still on about that? 'Tis ancient history now.
Muster up the grit and anyplace makes a fine storefront.
Little in the way of competition in these parts, besides.
Times are dark, friend. Darkest of all for merchants like me, I fear.
You'd expect most folk wantin' to be well-supplied for the dragon's coming, but no! Bah!
This may be the death of business, even for me.
Still, might as well keep at it till the end arrives, eh?
Say, that's lovely, ser.
<SHOP>Here you are: Today's goods.
Buy
Sell
Never mind
Pray, call again soon!
Pleasure doin' business!
Pray, call again soon!
Pray, call again soon!
<EQSH>If you've time to spare, you've time for a look-see.
Buy
Sell
Change equipment
Never mind
If you've time to spare, you've time for a look-see.
Ancient writings? Aye, that's simple enough. If you've the coin, that is.
What? Oh, you just want aught read? Let's have a look, then...
As I said, simple enough. That's "dragon" there. Then "scar," "Arisen," and "heart" there.
The rest is no script, friend, just flourish. This slate's no text. It's a cipher.
Like as not, it holds some secret meaning to folk those words relate to.
I'm not one of them. I fear that's all I can say, friend.
To your continued success, Arisen.
This seems hardly the time for festivities.
I'm afraid I am not a party person.
You'll have to excuse me, ser.
Please, restrain yourself.
It grieves me to burden you, weary from the road as you must be, but I fear trouble brews.
I would beg your assistance in this matter, Arisen, if it please you.
Hear more
Not now
...Then now is not the time. I understand. I shall await a more opportune moment.
You have my thanks.
Beyond lies the Everfall, an ancient place that sleeps beneath Gran Soren's stones.
We pawns have long served as keepers of the entrance to this place.
But since the dragon's coming, a strange aura has filled the Everfall. A...presence.
If it be some omen of evil to come, we cannot allow it go unchecked.
I ask that you seek out the cause of the change, or some proof of what's happened.
The Everfall is a place unique unto itself. This is not a simple task, nor a favor I ask lightly.
Which is why I ask you, Arisen. Please, lend us your aid.
Pray, lend me your ear, Arisen. We have need of your help.
Hear more
Not now
The Everfall is known to all, though few regard it as aught more than another ruin.
Fewer still venture near it.
...Perhaps they fear it, and so shun it as they do the pawn legion.
Even the legion does not know how the Everfall came to be, or what purpose it serves.
But all pawns hear its call... A voice within us commands we hold this place safe.
'Tis a powerful strange thing to those with no will of their own, to hear such a call.
A light, in the furthest depths, you say? I see...
In truth, even we pawns know precious little of the Everfall.
I can say with utmost certainty, though, the light you speak of is newly come.
We cannot know if this small aberration will give rise to great calamity hence.
But the chance enough is call to take action.
We shall redouble our efforts here, and keep vigilant for further signs of change.

Aye, there's a thief about, and I've the missing wares to prove it.
I even chanced to see the rat scurrying off after he'd lightened my stores.
Quick as a flash, he was. I'd have been impressed, had I not been so angry.
Not again...
This strength... Is this the temper of your will?
You have seen the world for the meaningless<cf>cycle that it is, yet even still...
Be cast into nothingness.
No paths lead hence.
Repent the folly of ascribing meaning to the void.
Naught shall remain.
Fall, molder, and be gone.
I have raged and wrought destruction.
With my every breath I cursed the eternal<cf>chain and all who would perpetuate it.
But more than this, I have waited...
Waited for one with a will to outmatch my<cf>own, that they may break the bonds that<cf>hold me here.
In hate's demise... freedom...
Even as his guest, I'll thank you to keep your distance from His Grace.
Are you not with the convoy, then!?
We were told to await a cart with important freight. We'll pass no strangers till then.
I'm thankful for the concern, but I'll take no joy if you work yourself ill.
I'm in your debt, goodfisher.
I pray you'll continue your service to the village. We are fortunate to have you.
What joy is living when I'll never be fit to sail again?

No Item
Aanh?
I've no use for you.
Keep your distance, filth.
You've no place here.
Scared, are you?
Be off with you.
Why are you here?
Don't get cocky, you.
To living easy, aye?
Hoy there. You look eager.
Kgh.
Guh!
Nnngh...
Ha!
Haaah!
Hello there.
Go, then...
'Course.
No, no.
Salude.
...I thank you.
Save your talk for the captain.
Do I look a captain to you?
Come on, come on, work to be done.
Well, let us be done with it, I say.
The captain's been with us half a year now, come here from afar, same as we.
I had dismissed her for a pampered princess, but the woman has grit. I'll grant her that, if nothing else.
Not that you'll hear me complain either way, long as I'm paid on time.
That turned out well enough, I daresay. Yes?
Demand perfection and you'll never get anything done, I say.
I'm glad enough to've survived, crossing a beast the likes of that.
Pontificating about the past is a luxury of the living.
...I thank you.
'Tis but one creature...<cf>Yet a formidable one.
What is it!?
What manner of foul creature...
An evil eye!
We've ill luck in enemies...
Beware its charge!
Beware its gaze!
It shields itself... Don't rush in blindly!
We'll get nowhere while that barrier holds!
There must be a way to close its eye...
We'll not break its barrier while<cf>the eye is open!
Powerful magick can break through<cf>its shield!
The beast can negate our magick!
Attack when it closes its mouth!
Its barrier falls while it eats!
Its barrier falls as it casts magick!
Its barrier is lowered while it<cf>intones a spell!
Its barrier falls while it restores<cf>its tentacles!
Now! Cleave out its eye!
I'll grab it -- take the chance to attack!
An unshielded tentacle!
'Tis so small! It's no threat to us.
Its barrier falls!
The barrier's fallen!
This should rid us of its shield!
Now, while it casts magick!
It falls! 'Tis the time to strike!
'Tis our best chance!<cf>I'll aim for the eye!
The eye is damaged! Keep attacking!
Keep up your attacks!
Keep on it! I'll aim for its eye!
Hurry, while it's fallen!
Evil eye!
A swarm of evil eyes!
There, Master! Evil eyes!
An evil eye! Beware!
Vile eye!
A swarm of vile eyes!
There, Master! Vile eyes!
A vile eye! Be wary!
E-evil eye!
The worst is come to pass, Arisen...
I cannot believe... 'Tis an evil eye!
What... What is it?
Beware its tendrils!
Waugh! Its tentacles...!
A tentacled fiend, Arisen!
The monster looks our way!
Our attacks do nothing!
I'll strike its tentacles!
I'll strip its barrier with a spell!
This ought break its barrier!
That barrier... I'll have it down!
I'll sacrifice myself! Strike it down!
Attack while it devours this pawn!
Rrgh, meddlesome thing!
Come! Eat this pawn, if you hunger so!
Now! Put out its eye!
Pierce the eye while it casts!
Arisen! The barrier is no more!
The barrier is fallen!
'Tis unshielded while its<cf>tendril regrows!
Can we strip its barrier by<cf>severing the tentacles?
The barrier falls while growing<cf>new tentacles!
Yes! 'Tis down!
Now! 'Tis open!
'Tis our chance -- destroy the eye!
It responds to powerful Archmagick<cf>with a sealing spell.
Let's have these tentacles off!
Its gaze holds a malevolent power!
Draw other beasts before the eye's<cf>glare!
We'll strike while it readies its<cf>glare!
Watch for those tentacles!
These beasts move freely through the air.
When its eye flashes, turn away!
Powerful spells should have an effect!
'Tis protected by a barrier!
The tentacles renew without end!
...It teleported!?
Seems the eye itself maintains the barrier.
From the ground...tentacles?
Do not be caught in its gaze!
It wields a barrier as well!?
What could that round mass be?
'Tis absolutely enormous!
A giant, monstrous eye!
Gazer!
A gazer! Strike it down!
Grab hold and strike the eye directly!
Its skin is tough as steel!
We must strike at its eye!
Edged weapons to the eye serve best!
It aims to cast fell magick!
It readies a lethal attack!
Cleave off its tentacles to make it<cf>easier to scale!
We cannot allow its incantation to<cf>finish!
Poison mist?! Seek higher ground!
It spews a noxious mist! Do not breathe<cf>it!
If we can lure that attack toward the<cf>eye...!
Strike the tentacles that store up<cf>magick!
Perhaps we can use the magickal<cf>energy it produces!
Keep at it! Again!
Wh-what is this mist?!
Its tentacles rise up from the earth!
The chest--it's...!
A beast?!
Maneater!
'Tis a maneater!
Darkness serves well against their ilk!
Take care you don't become its meal!
Beware its spell of death!
Its spittle acts to petrify flesh!
Hold fast, I'll save you!
That chest...'tis a maneater, I'm<cf>sure of it.
Some maneaters hold vast amounts of<cf>rift crystals within them.
We'll not allow it to escape.
Be wary! There are beasts that dwell<cf>within such chests.
No! It flees, master!
Be cautious when opening chests, ser.
I shall assay whether the chest is safe.
Guh.
Gaah!
Gwaaaugh...
Huh!
Shaha!
Ah, cousin.
Fortune to you, cos.
Aye, to be sure.
Do not be a fool.
What is this? Ah, very kind!
You are wonderful, you are!
Ah, but you're a quick one. An impressive piece of knavery you have.
Pretending to be Arisen so that the guards won't give you a bother? Brilliant!
I've got a bit of...professional admiration for you, I do.
I am something of a...trust artist myself, yes? It just took one of your own to see through that Arisen costume. 
I was thinking of pulling the old Arisen swindle on His Grace meself. Truly, I was!
Fortune surely favors you, what to beat an old spider like me to the thrust.
So you can go anywhere you like? Hmm... What I wouldn't give to have thought up this Arisen game sooner.
S'pose you'll wander the land now, yes? Maybe shake down a noble or two for a spare coin?
If people thought I was the Arisen? I'd tell them to give me all their gold before I overwhelmed them with my magick!
Ah! I just 'eard 'bout you from a guardsman. Said you even got the duke thinkin' you're the Arisen.
Ah, by the Maker! You even got some simpletons to pretend to be your pawns?
You make a fine Arisen. Might even take the dragon if you put your mind to it.
Wait! You really were the Arisen? All that time?
Ah, by the Maker's breath! I could have sworn you were having a laugh on them.
'Course, in light of your deeds and all that...
Well, whether you be true or false, in the end I s'pose it doesn't matter much now, does it?
You are wonderful, you are!
These stairs ought return us to the surface.
Just how far do these stairs go?
Seems we've found a shortcut to the<cf>surface.
Do you... Do you hear something?
Echoes of another's will linger here as<cf>voices.
An epitaph, perhaps? The message is still<cf>legible.
Our paths cross again.
He gets about in his wanderings.
He wanders these halls unaccompanied?<cf>...Impressive.
Seems he has no intention of leaving this<cf>place.
'Tis locked. You haven't the key to fit it...
'Tis caught on something. Perhaps it could open from the far side.
'Tis barred shut. Might be able to break the bolt.
'Tis shut tight.
'Tis no use at this hour. You'll have to come again later.
Best stop for now.
Seems they're closed.
Someone was here...
Lost them...
Gone...
Perhaps you've upset them.
There's naught to do here.
Best you moved on.
Not here...
The door is closed.
Shows no sign of opening.
There's aught there...
You don't see anything.
That smell...
Someone's near...
What's this...?
Fine view from here.
There's aught written here...
Must be a way to find something...
Smells delicious.
Perfect spot to place something.
You can almost reach...
There appears to be aught ahead.
That fall could kill.
'Tis dangerous to touch.
A strong blow might break it.
Perhaps if you came by night.
Perhaps if you came by day.
Perhaps if you came at dawn.
Perhaps if you came at dusk.
There's aught buried here...
You see no way up.
'Tis slick, this spot.
No use pressing any further.
No need to double back further.
No time for that now.
You cannot carry any more.
There may yet be aught lying about.
Seems there's naught you can take on at present.<cf>Best to try again later.
Perhaps with a bit of help...
Best you kept your weapon sheathed.
Is someone here...?
'Tis a place for tall folk.
'Tis a place for small folk.
Had you a woman in your band...
Had you a man in your band...
Had you a strong companion...
Had you a swift companion...
Had you a magick user...
Had you an apt climber...
Had you a skilled jumper...
This weapon will not help you.
That armor won't protect you.
You're ill equipped for this.
Seems it can't be used now.
You'll get no further use from it.
'Tis useless, now.
Hmm, not with your current equipment...
Not with your current party...
You hear aught from further in.
Enemies... They're close.
Best you got some rest.
You can carry no more!
You're too exhausted!
"Danger! Keep Out!"
"No Trespassing"
A sign.
Had you an Empty Flask, you might fill it here.
You'll get no further without a lantern.
'Tis dangerous to fumble about in the dark. Best find a light.
Best not just leave them.
If aught were left here, it would rot.
Best take care you don't get lost.
Best check the map.
You're due for a rest.
This place is dangerous by night.
This place is dangerous by day.
Breathtaking...
You'll get no further!
Seems you'll need to come back.
Nothing left here.
It looks fit to crumble.
Seems it could be moved...
It will not budge.
It will not open.
Seems you need a key.
Seems you need a Pickaxe here.
You yet lack the experience.
You yet lack the skill.
Not with your current vocation...
You'll not pass through this gate.
You've no time!
Seems you were too late.
You may make it, yet.
You're doing well for time.
Seems you've come at the wrong time.
There may be another path.
'Tis a powerful weapon... Too bad it doesn't work.
Uh!
Guh!
Wauuugh...
Hmph!
Eagh!
Hello.
Fare well.
Yes.
No.
Thank you.
I thank you, ser.
Pray welcome, Arisen. I am Jasper, though most name me Jasper the Gossip. 
I travel the land conducting...research on various matters. Doubtless you will have need of my services erelong.
I cry out to the people, urging strength and constancy, as much to brace myself against the weight of fear as to aid my fellow man.
Man is a delicate beast. Those who accept that fragility and carry on despite it are blessed.
For most, unease gives way to unrest, and rage then finds a home in their fearful hearts.
What? That conversation has long since ended... Forget it, ser.
Never before have I felt so grateful that each new day is no different than the last, Arisen.
You have spared my kin and I a most unwelcome change, and for that you have our thanks.
I fear that, in my passion calling out to my fellow man, I oft lose sight of myself...
I had known the Arisen for a lofty sort.
I am saddened to learn that the cries of the poor do not carry up to your exalted station.
We bear injustice, ser, and are left to curse our fortunes and live on as best we can.
I see now that deliverance is beyond the reach of my kind.
I can tell you little at the moment, I'm afraid.
Ask anything of me, Arisen. If I can aid you in even some small way, I shall endeavor to do so. 
I will inform you at once should I happen upon news that would interest you.
Hmm... Nothing worthy to give you at present, no.
Return any time -- I may hear something for you yet.
And so evil falls before the sword of justice... Would that the matter were so simple.
This solves nothing. Naught that truly matters...
I know not whom to trust, any more...
If the Maker watches on, He does it with all the compassion of the wyrm itself.
In the days since the dragon's arrival, it has come to take up less and less talk of the streets.
Perhaps the people have grown numb even to fear.
The city... 'Tis an act of the Maker, else the hand of some demon!
Arisen, did you know of this when... When you...
Or perhaps this is all your... No. Surely that cannot be...
I am lost to confusion... If you harbor any pity for your children, Maker, pray, grant me insight...
Who among you has seen the dragon? Who saw it raze a village at the southern shore?
No doubt you were filled with fear and awe, with trepidation, with despair...
And why? Because mankind e'er fears that which it does not understand.
We dread the unknown, and ill know how to respond. At times, we abandon all thought and settle into the coward's refuge of desperation.
'Tis our nature, aye, but is it right?
Is our only choice truly to bow down in submission to the awesome threat before us?
No! I say that our war against the unknown must begin with knowledge.
We must come to understand the dragon...the Maker...ourselves.
Let the light of human knowledge dispel the shadows of fear and desperation!
For the day we truly understand the wyrm and well know ourselves, the path we must follow will be laid open before us.
People of Gransys, we stand now at a crossroads.
Do we submit to the tides of fear and chaos...or do we strike out? Strike out against the waves of hardship, valor and wisdom our rudder and oar?
The true and just among us need turn not to the Faith, nor the Crown, but instead to that voice within ourselves. To heed the exhortations of our souls!
We must think for ourselves and act of ourselves, brothers.
Therein lies our only hope of cleaving a path through chaos and fallen order, that we may walk steadfast into the future.
Pray, place a hand o'er your breast and call your racing heart to calm. Doubt surrounds us at every quarter...
Do not lose sight of the hope that lies beyond. Mistake not the light that shines beyond the dragon's shadow!
I thank you, ser.
A woman...?
I hear song...
A bird, perhaps?
A fiend with a woman's form!
Harpy!
A flock of harpies!
Harpy song...
I hear harpy song.
That's a harpy's voice!
Ignore the comely face --<cf>those talons bite deep!
Beware when the creature dives!
Harpies will snatch you and fly!
Don't let them drag you off!
Beware the harpy's voice!
Set the harpy ablaze!
Burn their wings!
Grapple the wretch as it flies!
Its song can rob you of movement!
Strike it when it alights!
As it nears the ground,<cf>attack it directly.
Focus your attacks as it hovers.
We cannot allow it flight!
Harpies have the advantage in the air...
We must keep it aground!
I'll set its wings ablaze.
Its wings are vulnerable to fire.
This ought to keep it aground!
'Tis too nimble!
I'll aim for the wings!
Focus on burning the wings!
Now! I'll set it ablaze!
I'll strike with fire afore it<cf>recovers!
Tis within range of our steel!
It's within striking range!
It flies low...our steel will serve well!
Quick, while it's in reach!
Strike, lest the harpy sing!
Slay them afore they can use their<cf>voice!
Beware the harpy's song!
Their song is fell magick.
Lure them down and strike!
There, Master! Harpies!
There, a harpy!
Snow harpy!
A flock of snow harpies!
There, Master! Snow harpies!
Master, a snow harpy!
A succubus!
A brood of succubi!
There, Master! Succubi!
A succubus, there!
Gargoyle!
A team of gargoyles!
There, Master! Gargoyles!
A gargoyle comes!
Their song induces slumber.
Once they close in, attack!
Grounded, they're easy prey.
A harpy's roost, atop the tree.
Their screams chill the blood to ice!
This is snow harpy territory.
They say some harpies can<cf>freeze a man.
Seems light serves well.
Their shrieks blind all who hear it.
Succubus! Arms at the ready, Master!
Do you know a bat-winged monster,<cf>Arisen?
I hear succubi about! Be ready!
I saw a succubus here some days past.
Their tail can turn a man to stone.
Provoke an attack, then dodge it!
The ceiling, Arisen! Gargoyles!
They cling to the ceiling in ambush.
Have we a remedy for petrifaction?
'Tis a gargoyles' roost, this place...
Would that we could drag them to<cf>earth...
'Twas a strange bird, just now.
Giant...bats?
Are they not harpies?
Their skin looks hard as stone!
Above us! On the ceiling!
A blue harpy...?
That harpy wears scales!
Sirens!
Deaden your ears! Sirens!
A temptation of sirens!
Darkness is bane to sirens!
The beasts' wounds close before our eyes!
We must silence their singing!
Their song heals their fellow beast!
I've ne'er heard such a melody before!
Let us be rid of the sirens first!
A spell of silence will stop their song!
It looks an overgrown bat...
Crimson beasts!
Strigoi!
Strigoi, Arisen!
A cloud of strigoi fly close!
Ice serves well against strigoi!
Watch they do not suck your lifeblood!
They grow stronger by drinking blood!
Strigoi that have drunk blood are said to<cf>yield a rare material!
It grows stronger as the fight wears on?!
Be vigilant of those with red tails!
Strike them from the air, then fall upon<cf>them!
Ngh... S-strength...leaving me...
H-help me!
Hmph...
The other men may go in for fairy tales, but you'll get no favor from me, Arisen.
Make trouble on my watch and you'll answer for it, same as anyone else.
Salvation? Bah, they're a loathsome lot.
Skulking about and plotting mischief, turning sane folk mad...
They eat away at the duchy like a hive of bloody woodworms.
And what sort of madness, to worship the dragon?
All the devotion in the world won't make a man any less tasty by the beast's reckoning.
My charge is to serve as His Grace's shield.
If I die fighting along Edmun Dragonsbane, I'll count it<cf>an honor.
The Church may know aught of that<cf>tablet.
Mayhap some member of the Faith could<cf>read the tablet.
Let us ask at a Church.
We ought ask a priest or monk about the<cf>tablet.
The tablet is engraved in Wyrmspeak.
The Dragonforged of Hillfigure Knoll<cf>ought know of it.
The Dragonforged lives north of Gran<cf>Soren.
Surely the Dragonforged of Hillfigure<cf>Knoll can decipher the tablet.
Let us bring that Witchwood tablet to<cf>the Dragonforged.
We can have the tablet from the<cf>Witchwood deciphered here.
You've received something very<cf>precious, Arisen.
One "bound to you most powerfully"...<cf>To whom will you give your oath?
Hillfigure Knoll takes its name from the<cf>grand drawing it bears.
'Tis not overly far to the knoll, Master.<cf>Let's be off.
I hear the hermit who lives atop this hill<cf>is<cf>nigh-fluent in Wyrmspeak.
I wanna grow stronger. I have to!
I'll get that dragon, just wait and see.
What's... Why's this happening?
I wanna grow stronger. I have to!
What's... Why's this happening?
Huh? D'you call me?
You don't want to be without a place to come home to, do you?
Wondrous tidings, Arisen. The duke is to grant you an audience.
His Grace wishes to commend you for your valor and your service to the land.
Know, however, that any errand you have taken on will be left to another to complete.
You will also be asked to return your writ of permission to join the Hunt.
If you have aught left undone, pray, tend to it afore you come to see the duke, ser.
I must be clear: Your audience with His Grace will put an end to any current tasks, and you will be asked to return your license to the Wyrm Hunt.
Knowing that, are you prepared to see His Grace now?
Yes
No
I must be clear: Your audience with His Grace will put an end to any current tasks, and you will be asked to return your license to the Wyrm Hunt.
Knowing that, are you prepared to see His Grace now?
Yes
No
You are quite certain? No tasks left incomplete? No need for the license to the Hunt?
Yes
No
Understood. Then pray, enter the castle, ser.
A guide awaits within to see you to His Grace.
I see. Then go, and tend to what business keeps you, ser. I will await you here.
Rrgh!
Have you cast yourself into the void, ser?
It seems the shaft empties upon itself in a never-ending cycle, top to bottom.
I would ask aught of you, Arisen...
Please... Take this.
My mistress gathered their like as she sought her way through the depths.
She died ere she was done. If you would take up her task, pray bring them here to me.
I trust that you will see my mistress' will done.
I beseech you. Bring the Wakestones here.
I shall await you further on.
Yes, at last... At last you've gathered the whole of them.
With them, you can summon forth a rift of considerable power.
This rift, born of the Wakestones' power, will guide you forward, Arisen.
I fear there will be no returning to this place. Are you prepared to journey on?
Yes
Not yet
This pawn will await you here.
End this, Arisen. May the world be put right by your hand.
It seems the office of Arisen brings with it equal parts strength and ambition...
I am greatly pleased by your works, ser. I would see you rewarded for all you've done.
Come, follow me. I have aught to give you afore you set out.
Take all you see here, Arisen.
May you find use of it in the coming days.
There is one treasure among them I cannot offer, though, for the chest is bound with magick.
The key is a sorceled trinket of mine, the Wyrmking's Ring. Regrettably, 'tis not at hand.
When it returns to me, I shall see you receive the treasure it guards as well.
There's no call for humility, ser. Take it.
The expedition will no doubt hold its share of dangers. May the Maker speed your steps.
Strange.
The ring ought hold sway over the lock that binds this chest...
No matter. I shall see its contents are delivered to you later.
...Perhaps time has dulled the ring's magick?
The expedition will keep, Arisen.
Head for the Greatwall at once and quash Salvation's designs afore they're realized.
This matter takes precedence over all others. Now, go.

I heard tell Quina had taken the cloth... It seems the talk was true.
Blessed flowers? Ah, of course. I've seen her handiwork as a healer myself.
Novice though I may be, I am a priest of the Faith.
Were I to inspect a blossom she blessed, I should be able to judge the extent of her talent.
Maker's breath! ...Er, pardon. Still, 'tis more than I'd imagined. She truly harbors a gift.
She was ever eager to put her healing skills to use on you, Arisen...
But with proper training, her abilities will grow to be a force of mercy and hope for the Faith and all its children.
I pray the Maker ever watch over Quina in her journey.
Do give my best wishes to the Mother Superior next you visit the abbey.
Ugh.
Guh!
Waaaugh...
Ha!
Shu-ha!
Hail.
Fare well.
Aye.
Ehh...
You needn't have.
I suppose that merits my gratitude.
I cannot let you past.
Oy! Stop that!
Where've you gone...?
Off with you!
You're free to pass.
Don't do anything foolish.
Accept your fate.
People do not simply vanish...
Over there!
Don't let them get away!
Times are hard indeed...
What is it?
That's enough.
I'll not go through life cowering in fear.
A guardsman's wage is hardly worth the danger.
You all right?
...What's your problem?
Ach, here. I can't stand to watch you.
What can we do but hope the Maker preserves us?
D'you suppose there's any hope for Gransys?
'Tis a nightmare come real...
You needn't have.
'Twas me. I confess it! I took the father's book from the chapel.
I tried to go back and find the book, but I was in such a panic as I ran...
I just wanted a look at it... Just curious, is all.
Forgive me. I cannot remember where I lost it...
I'd thought to steal a glance then return it, but the dragon came and I...
I dropped it as I ran... Cor, what am I to say to him now?
Then the father still doesn't know? ...Thank you.
But I was wrong to have taken his book. I will go and ask his pardon.
If he will forgive me, I shall go to the chapel every day to pray!
Wh-where did you find it?
I am glad it's found, but... See it back to the father for me? Please?
...Thank you.
The room is ablaze!
The flames show no sign of dying out...
I cannot fathom His Grace's waste of coin on such festivity while our defenses stand bare.
...Just the same, I'll not refuse his wine.
Aaaah!
I... No...
Welcome to Gran Soren, proud seat of Duke Edmun Dragonsbane himself.
I heard the dragon was sighted nearby. ...B-but fear not! The duke is sure to protect us!
They say the wyrm fled for the mountains, thank the Maker...
B-but that don't mean we throw wide the gate and let folks pass as they please. Who knows what other evils are out there?
So, you're the Arisen, eh? Thought you had a magickal look about you. Don't suppose you'd conjure me up a few gold pieces, eh?
You Arisen can go anywhere you please. Always been that way.
Me? I can't even leave the house without word from the missus. More than a bit unjust, don't you think?
Oh ho! Off on a special mission from His Grace, are we? Very fine to enjoy such trust, very fine indeed.
Don't suppose you'd care to mention ol' Serdic to the duke next time you see him? Let him know what a...fine job I'm doing with the...guarding of the gate here? ...Eh?
Oh, go on. Hop back and forth through the gate like a rabbit for all I care.
West of this gate lies the Greatwall. And there's nothing what can hope to pass through that.
By the Maker... If the Greatwall's fallen, we're all undone.
We'll never defeat the dragon... It's hopeless. Hopeless!
The city's in ruins, the sky's gone foul... The Maker's turned his back on poor Serdic this day, I tell you.

Mnh.
Guhah!
Nraaaugh...
Hoh!
Shaaah!
Join me for a drink?
Cheers, cos.
Aye, precisely.
No!
Ah, sorry for the trouble.
That's quite the boon, goodfisher.
Ahh, my thanks, minnow.
I thank you.
She's back! Maker be praised she's back!<cf>The alehouse is open once more!
Ask Inez what it was brought her back to Cassardis, and she'll tell you it's her patrons.
Well, there's not a man around's given her half the custom over the years I have!
Let the dragon come and the doomcriers shout themselves blue. They can find me at the bar!
It's as Inez says: All a man needs is drink, song, and company for the night!
Come to think on it, there was a strange man come 'round the village a while back. Wore a tattered hood.
Seemed a curious sort. I haven't seen him since.
Each day I stand watch, then drink till I can't stand, same as I always have.
None of that's changed with the dragon's coming.
A man of my years has no cause to worry.
Long as I've ale in my hand and a pretty girl to toast, I can die in peace.
Inez is young yet. I pray the wyrm lets her live, at least.
Not that any of our fates are sealed just yet, mind.
It's the thought of the bar that sees me through each day of work.
Were I your age, I'd run. Take Inez with me, too.
I'd run...or set out to slay the beast myself, same as you.
Last there was a dragon in Gransys, I was still but a wee minnow.
Now the wyrm is back, and I'm well old.
I suppose I was never meant to play the champion.
How fares your journey? I'd gladly hear tales from the road over an ale sometime.
As I recall it, old Adaro wanted to leave on his own Wyrm Hunt in his youth.
You may not have his blood, but you're his child just the same, there's no denying.
Course, last Wyrm Hunt, Adaro wasn't but a minnow back then, same as me.
We both stayed right here in the village.
Now, every time the wind carries in word of your exploits, his chest puffs out a bit more.
There's no man likes to brag more than a proud father. And that's coming from a drunk!
I can feel it in these old bones... It won't be long now. The beast is stirring.
Inez and the others are carrying on best they can. It's not that they aren't afeared of death.
Just, it's all too grand to grasp. No one knows what to do.
I'm no different than anyone else...
It shames me to say, but for all my years I still know precious little about dragons.
We're all just as leaves, caught in the waves.
In to shore or out to sea, it's a tide far grander than us that decides our fate.
So, the beast has woken...
It's a curious thing, the Wyrm Hunt.
Any sane man knows it's the stuff of dreams and legend, for a man to fell a dragon.
Those like you, who let belief in man's strength guide them...maybe you're the sane ones after all.
Slay the wyrm or no, there's a worth to what you've done.
What's that? I asked a favor...? Me? ...You're certain?
You trounced the beast, just as I always said you would!
That's twice in my days I've seen the dragon come, and twice man has slain it!
Perhaps mankind's stronger that I'd thought.
Than any of us thought, in truth.
You have this old man's thanks.
Whatever time the Maker sees fit to give me now, I can die happy having seen your feats.
All that's left is to heed Inez's advice -- drink, and be merry!
It's the thought of the bar that sees me through each day of work.
Join me for a drink?
Where could that book have gotten to?
Where could it be? We'll need<cf>to search low and high.
The scriptures are supposed to<cf>be near, but... Hmm...
We'd best check places people rarely go.
There must be places nearby<cf>that we cannot easily see.
Let's split up.
Let's move on.
To the chapel, Arisen.
The priest awaits, Master.
Where would a mischievous child play?
Twould be a safe place, but one with<cf>a view of the dragon... A rooftop?
'Tis like to hide away from sight.<cf>On a roof, perhaps, or...hmm.
Do you suppose we'll find it so easily?
Memory is naught but a record inked upon my mind...
But then, whence this fluttering in my breast...
And what wets my cheek at the sight of my master's legacy?
Mnh.
Hngh!
Gwaaugh...
Huh!
Eagh!
Speak your mind.
You may go.
Mm.
No.
Hmm, not bad.
Mm, I am glad of it.
Presumptuous fool!
Put this blackguard to chains!
I await good word of your deeds. You are dismissed.
Come no closer. I've no time for you.
If it is work you want, seek Aldous.
I'll send word if I have need of you. Be on your way.
Do you think me an idle man? Do not test my patience further.
This is a far cry from goblins at the Mountside Fort.
The Greatwall is Gran Soren's own shield. Action must be taken at once.
Damn the lot of those zealots, and damn me for allowing them this far.
Hrm...
You've come a great ways from gutting fish in some shoreline hovel.
I trust you will serve your duke well, Arisen.
Free access to the castle is quite an honor.
Honor enough for the most ambitious commoner, I should<cf>think.
Were you to quit the Wyrm Hunt now, who would dare gainsay your valor?
Heed this well, Arisen.
To challenge the dragon is to challenge Edmun Dragonsbane. It will not stand.
Mm, I am glad of it.
I am he who sheds the mortal coil.
We are the Nameless Men.
Your life belongs to us.
Elites or no, I'd feel better at ease with a few more men...
'Tis stronger than I'd feared...
Damned creature!
Arisen, soon you shall learn!
The promised time is come -- the cleansing flames of the dragon!
Destruction for all! Destruction is all!
This is the only way we can save this doomed world!
I really must thank you, ser.
This pawn is a fighter, ser.
You can rely on my steel during close-quarters combat.
What are you doing!? Flee!
Seems that...Elegian? Elysion, was it?
Some old fraud's come to the capital to foment trouble with his queer preaching.
We've enough to fret about without his kind adding to<cf>our woes...
Fournival's to remain captive until such time as he's acquitted.
Ever calm and cautious, my master was... Ever vigilant and swift to respond...
Aye, 'twas this pawn's failing that cost her life. Had I but stayed that one blow...
